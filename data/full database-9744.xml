  <description>Rifamycin is the prime member of the rifamycin family which are represented by drugs that are a product of fermentation from the gram-positive bacterium _Amycolatopsis mediterranei_, also known as _Streptomyces mediterranei_. The parent compound of rifamycin was rifamycin B which was originally obtained as a main product in the presence of diethylbarburitic acid. Some small modifications where performed in this inactive compound and with the creation of rifamycin SV there was the first antibiotic used intravenously for the treatment of tuberculosis.[A39990]&#13;
&#13;
Rifamycin has had several direct derivative products such as rifamycin SV, rifaximin, rifampin and rifamycin CV. All of the derivatives have slight different physicochemical properties when compared to the parent structure.[A39986]&#13;
&#13;
Rifamycin was further developed by Cosmo Technologies Ltd and approved in November 16, 2018 by the FDA as a prescription drug after being granted the designation of Qualified Infectious Disease Product which allowed it to have a status a priority review.[L4800] This drug was also sent for review to the EMA in 2015 by Dr. Falk Pharma Gmbh and it was granted a waiver for the tested conditions.[L4801]</description>

  <indication>Rifamycin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of _E. coli_. The status of the disease should not be complicated by fever or blood in the stool. To prevent drug-resistant bacteria, it is important to mention that the use of rifamycin for this indication should be only done in cases where the infection is proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.[L4802]&#13;
&#13;
Travallers' diarrhea is very common problem affecting 20-60% of the travellers and it is defined as an increase in frequency of bowel movements to three or more loose stools per day during a trip abroad. This condition is rarely life threatening but in severe cases it can produce dehydration and sepsis. The most common cause of travellers' diarrhea is a pathogen and from the pathogens identified, bacteria is the most common cause followed by norovirus, rotavirus and similar viruses.[A39995]</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Rifamycin is known to be effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and mycobacteria. It is very effective against _E. coli_ reporting a MIC90 of 64-128 mcg/ml without showing cross-resistance with other antimicrobial agents.[A39996]&#13;
&#13;
The specific indication of rifampycin is extremely important as ther were previous reports that indicated a high risk factor in the generation of resistant _E. coli_ strains in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.[L4804]&#13;
&#13;
In clinical trials, rifamycin was tested in a randomized clinical trial of travellers' coming from Mexico and Guatemala. In this trial, rifamycin was proven to significantly reduce the symptoms of travellers' diarrhea.[L4802]</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Rifamycins, as well as all the other members of this group, present an antibacterial mechanism of action related to the inhibition of RNA synthesis. This mechanism of action is done by the strong binding to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of prokaryotes. The inhibition of the RNA synthesis is thought to be related with the initiation phase of the process and to involve stacking interactions between the naphthalene ring and the aromatic moiety in the polymerase. As well, it has been suggested that the presence of zinc atoms in the polymerase allows for the binding of phenolic -OH groups of the naphthalene ring.[T366] &#13;
&#13;
In eukaryotic cells, the binding is significantly reduced making them at least 100 to 10,000 times less sensitive to the action of rifamycins. The members of the rifamycin family present the same mechanism of action and the structural modifications are usually related to pharmacokinetic properties as well as to the interaction with eukaryotic cells.[A40003]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>In safety studies with rifamycin, it was reported a potential of hepatotoxicity due to the depletion of glutathione and the generation of reactive oxygen species in liver microsomes. It is important to mention that this effect is mainly observed in the intravenous administration as the oral dosage does not have a significant systemic absorption.[A33279]&#13;
&#13;
Rifamycin is not genotoxic in bacterial mutation assays, mouse cell mutation assay or mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. There is no current information about the effects on fertility, overdosage or carcinogenesis.[FDA label]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>When absorbed, rifamycin is mainly metabolzied in hepatocytes and intestinal microsomes to a 25-deacetyl metabolite.[A39998]</metabolism>
  <absorption>Rifamycin has a very poor absorption[A39996] and thus, the generation of an oral modified-release formulation using the technology of the multi-matrix structure was required for the generation of the FDA approved product. This preparation allows the delivery of the active ingredient in the distal small bowel and colon without interfering with the flora in the upper gastrointestinal tract.[A39997]&#13;
&#13;
The multi-matrix is made by a lipophiic matrix surrounded in a hydrophilic matrix which allows for the protection of the active ingredient from dissolution in the intestinal aqueous fluids before it arrives in the cecum. All this matrix is surrounded by a gastro-resistant polymer that only desintegrate in a pH lower than 7.[A39998]&#13;
&#13;
All this administration-customed formulation allows for a bioavailability of &lt;0.1% and the plasma concentrations are reported to be of &lt;2 ng/ml in patients receiving a dose of 400 mg. This confirms that the site of action of rifamycin stays in the small intestine and colon which prevents the need for dose adjustments in special populations as well as systemic drug interactions.[A39998]&#13;
&#13;
The reported Cmax, tmax, AUC and mean residence time after a dosage of 250 mg of rifamycin is 36 mg/L, 5 min, 11.84 mg.h/L and 0.49 h respectively.[A39998]</absorption>
  <half-life>The reported half-life when a dose of 250 mg of rifamycin was administered is 3 h.[A39998]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>The protein binding of rifamycin is of about 80-95%.[A33279]</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>From the administered dose, 18%, 50% and 21% is recovered in feces during the first 24, 48 and 72h after administration. This will represent about 90% of the administered dose eliminated by the feces while the urinary secretion is negligible.[A39998]</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The reported volume of distribution after measured after a dosage of 250 mg of rifamycin is 101.8 L.[A39998]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The reported clearance when a dose of 250 mg of rifamycin was administered is 23.3 L/h.[A39998]</clearance>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. In the epoxidation of arachidonic acid it generates only 14,15- and 11,12-cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Most active in catalyzing 2-hydroxylation. Caffeine is metabolized primarily by cytochrome CYP1A2 in the liver through an initial N3-demethylation. Also acts in the metabolism of aflatoxin B1 and acetaminophen. Participates in the bioactivation of carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Catalizes the N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines and the O-deethylation of phenacetin.</specific-function>

        <name>Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1</name>
        <general-function>Monovalent cation:proton antiporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Solute transporter for tetraethylammonium (TEA), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), cimetidine, N-methylnicotinamide (NMN), metformin, creatinine, guanidine, procainamide, topotecan, estrone sulfate, acyclovir, ganciclovir and also the zwitterionic cephalosporin, cephalexin and cephradin. Seems to also play a role in the uptake of oxaliplatin (a new platinum anticancer agent). Able to transport paraquat (PQ or N,N-dimethyl-4-4'-bipiridinium); a widely used herbicid. Responsible for the secretion of cationic drugs across the brush border membranes.</specific-function>
