  <name>Sufentanil</name>
  <description>Sufentanil is an opioid analgesic that is used as an adjunct in anesthesia, in balanced anesthesia, and as a primary anesthetic agent.  It is administered by the intravenous, epidural and sublingual routes. &#13;
&#13;
Also known as _Dsuvia_, the sublingual form is used for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, including hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments [L4717]. Consideration may be made in the future for the use of the sublingual form in the US military in cases where analgesia is required immediately [L4718].&#13;
&#13;
The sublingual form, manufactured by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AcelRx), was approved on November 2, 2018 [L4717].&#13;
This route of administration is intended to be a simple, effective, non-invasive analgesic option to enable healthcare professionals to rapidly manage acute pain without difficult intravenous or epidural administration [L4717], [A39633].</description>

  <indication>The indications for this drug are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
1. As an analgesic adjunct in the maintenance of balanced general anesthesia in patients who are intubated and ventilated.&#13;
&#13;
2. As a primary anesthetic agent for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia with 100% oxygen in patients undergoing major surgical procedures, in patients who are intubated and ventilated, such as cardiovascular surgery or neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position, to provide favorable myocardial and cerebral oxygen balance or when extended postoperative ventilation is anticipated.&#13;
&#13;
3. For epidural administration as an analgesic combined with low dose (usually 12.5 mg per administration) bupivacaine usually during labor and vaginal delivery &#13;
&#13;
4. The sublingual form is indicated for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, including hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments.&#13;
&#13;

  <pharmacodynamics>**Effect on the Central Nervous System (CNS)**&#13;
&#13;
 In clinical settings, sufentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain. This drug depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils [F2009], [A39637]. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl [FDA label]. High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity, likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain. Sleep-inducing (hypnotic) activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Effects on the Respiratory System**&#13;
&#13;
Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Effects on the Cardiovascular System**&#13;
&#13;
Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Bradycardia may also occur [F2009]. Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract**&#13;
&#13;
Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased and lead to spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase [FDA label].</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Sufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to μ-opioid receptors [F2009]. These receptors are widely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues [A39636], [A39637].&#13;
&#13;
In general, opioids decrease cAMP (affecting neural signaling pathways), decrease neurotransmitter release, and cause membrane hyperpolarization, all of which contribute to the relief of painful symptoms [A39637].&#13;
&#13;
Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic neural transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate receptor leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP, located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is then inhibited [A39637]. &#13;
&#13;
Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist), also preventing neurotransmitter release [A39637].&#13;
&#13;
Sufentanil and other opioids open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability [A39636], [A39637]. </mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>**LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;:** 18.7 mg/kg (IV in mice) [MSDS]&#13;
&#13;
**A Note on Respiratory Depression**&#13;
&#13;
Major, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even in cases where it is used as recommended. Respiratory depression may lead to respiratory arrest and death if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. This drug should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, including respiration and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated. This training must include the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Carcinogenesis**&#13;
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of sufentanil have not been conducted [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Mutagenesis**&#13;
Sufentanil was not found to be genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleous assay [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Reproductive Toxicity**&#13;
&#13;
Sufentanil caused embryolethality in rats and rabbits treated for 10-30 days during pregnancy with 2.5 times the maximum human dose by intravenous administration. The embryolethal effect was thought to be secondary to the toxicity for the mother animal model. No negative effects were noted in another study in rats that were treated with 20 times the maximum human dose in the period of organogenesis. The preclinical effects were only seen following administrations of levels significantly above the maximum human dose, which is therefore of minimal relevance for clinical use [F2009].&#13;
&#13;
**Pregnancy**&#13;
&#13;
May cause fetal harm [FDA label]&#13;
&#13;
**The Use in Lactation**&#13;
&#13;
Infants exposed to this drug through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression [FDA label].</toxicity>
  <metabolism>The liver and small intestine are the major sites of biotransformation [FDA label].&#13;
Sufentanil is rapidly metabolized to a number of inactive metabolites, with oxidative N- and O-dealkylation being the major routes of elimination [F2009].</metabolism>
  <absorption>Bioavailability of a single sublingual tablet was 52%, decreasing to 35% with repeat dosing [A39629].&#13;
&#13;
After epidural administration of incremental doses totaling 5 to 40 mcg sufentanil during labor and delivery, maternal and neonatal sufentanil plasma concentrations were at or near the 0.05 to 0.1 ng/mL limit of detection, and were slightly higher in mothers than in their infants [FDA label].&#13;
</absorption>
  <half-life>The elimination half-life is 164 minutes in adults when administered intravenously (IV). The elimination half-life of sufentanil is shorter (e.g. 97 +/- 42 minutes) in infants and children, and longer in neonates (e.g. 434 +/- 160 minutes) compared to that of adolescents and adults [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
After a single administration of a 15 microgram sufentanil sublingual tablet, mean terminal phase half-lives in the range of 6-10 hours have been observed. After multiple administrations, a longer average terminal half-life of up to 18 hours was measured, owing to the higher plasma concentrations of sufentanil achieved after repeated dosing and due to the possibility to quantify these concentrations over a longer time period [F2009].&#13;
&#13;
</half-life>
  <protein-binding>Plasma protein binding of sufentanil, related to the alpha acid glycoprotein concentration, was approximately 93% in healthy males, 91% in mothers and 79% in neonates [FDA label].</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Approximately 80% of the administered dose is excreted within 24 hours and only 2% of the dose is eliminated as unchanged drug [FDA label].</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution> Sufentanil has a distribution time of 1.4 minutes and redistribution time of 17.1 minutes [FDA label].&#13;
The central volume of distribution after intravenous application of sufentanil is approximately 14 L and the volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 350 L [F2009].</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The total plasma clearance after single intravenous administration is about 917 l/min [F2009].&#13;
&#13;
The clearance of sufentanil in healthy neonates is approximately one-half that in adults and children. The clearance rate of sufentanil can be further reduced by up to a third in neonates with cardiovascular disease [FDA label]. </clearance>

        <name>Mu-type opioid receptor</name>
        <general-function>Voltage-gated calcium channel activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl, etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins. The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation. Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects. Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>G-protein coupled receptor that functions as receptor for endogenous enkephalins and for a subset of other opioids. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibits neurotransmitter release by reducing calcium ion currents and increasing potassium ion conductance. Plays a role in the perception of pain and in opiate-mediated analgesia. Plays a role in developing analgesic tolerance to morphine.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>G-protein coupled opioid receptor that functions as receptor for endogenous alpha-neoendorphins and dynorphins, but has low affinity for beta-endorphins. Also functions as receptor for various synthetic opioids and for the psychoactive diterpene salvinorin A. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibits neurotransmitter release by reducing calcium ion currents and increasing potassium ion conductance. Plays a role in the perception of pain. Plays a role in mediating reduced physical activity upon treatment with synthetic opioids. Plays a role in the regulation of salivation in response to synthetic opioids. May play a role in arousal and regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>
