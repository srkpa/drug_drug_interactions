  <description>Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic synthetically derived from oxytetracycline [FDA label].  This drug is a second-generation tetracycline, exhibiting lesser toxicity than first-generation tetracyclines [A174034]. Doxycycline may be used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections, depending on the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing.</description>

  <indication>Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of various infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes, as well other types of bacteria. A complete list of organisms is available in the FDA label and in the "indications" section of this drug entry [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
The following are some of the major infections that may be treated with doxycycline [FDA label]:&#13;
&#13;
Rocky mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae&#13;
&#13;
Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae&#13;
&#13;
Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis&#13;
&#13;
Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydia psittaci&#13;
&#13;
Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated as judged by immunofluorescence&#13;
&#13;
Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis&#13;
&#13;
Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis&#13;
&#13;
Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum&#13;
&#13;
Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis&#13;
&#13;
**A note regarding anti-microbial resistance**&#13;
&#13;
It is important to note that doxycycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.&#13;
Up to 44 percent of strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 74 percent of Streptococcus faecalis have been found to be resistant to tetracyclines. Therefore, tetracyclines such as doxycycline should not be used to treat streptococcal infections unless the microorganism has been demonstrated to be susceptible [FDA label].</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>The tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are mainly bacteriostatic and are thought to exert antimicrobial effects by the inhibition of protein synthesis.   Bacteriostatic antibiotics suppress the growth of bacteria, or keep them in the stationary phase of growth [A174025]. The tetracyclines, including doxycycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, treating numerous infectious diseases. Cross-resistance of these microorganisms to tetracyclines is a common occurrence [FDA label].   Doxycycline shows favorable intra-cellular penetration, with bacteriostatic activity on a wide range of bacteria [A174028]. Doxycycline has antiparasitic effects [A372], [A373], [A174025]. In addition to the above effects, this drug has demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions, which may help to manage inflammatory conditions such as rosacea [A174031]. </pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>In bacterial replication, an interaction that is important for translation initiation of proteins occurs at the 3′ end of the 16S rRNA, found on the ribosome on the 30S subunit [A174046], [A19429],  [A174070].  The 30S subunit is the smaller subunit of the ribosome of prokaryotes, including bacteria[F3073]. &#13;
&#13;
 Tetracyclines such as doxycycline are thought to inhibit translation by binding to the 16S rRNA portion of the ribosome [A174040], preventing binding of tRNA to the RNA-30S bacterial ribosomal subunit,  which is necessary for the delivery of amino acids for protein synthesis.  As a result of the above actions, the initiation of protein synthesis by polyribosome formation is blocked. This stops the replication of bacteria and produces a bacteriostatic effect  [F3052].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>There are various precautions to be undertaken while doxycyline is administered [F3052].  A full list of adverse events is included in the "Adverse Effects" section of this drug entry.&#13;
&#13;
**A note on tooth development and tetracycline use**&#13;
&#13;
The use of tetracyclines, such as doxycycline during the first half of pregnancy as well as during certain periods in childhood up to 8 years may lead to tooth enamel hypoplasia and yellow-gray discoloration of teeth.  It is advisable not to administer doxycycline in this age group according to the FDA label, except for in cases of post-exposure cases of anthrax (including inhalational anthrax) [FDA label].  Other sources state that doxycycline should not be administered in children under 12 years [F3052].&#13;
&#13;
**A note on Clostridium difficile**&#13;
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis may result from doxycycline use. Administering antibacterial agents changes the normal flora of the colon leading to an overgrowth of C. difficile. This bacteria produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD [F3052]. in moderate to severe cases, therapy with a suitable oral antibacterial agent effective against Clostridium difficile should be considered. Fluids, electrolytes and protein replacement should be provided when warranted [F3052].&#13;
&#13;
**A note on gastrointestinal irritation**&#13;
Gastrointestinal irritation may also occur. Rarely, esophagitis and esophageal ulcers have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. Most of these patients took medication immediately before going to bed. Administration of appropriate amounts of fluid with the tablets is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration, and late evening ingestion of the dose should be avoided [F3052]. To decrease the risk of gastric irritation, it is recommended that doxycycline is taken with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not significantly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk [F3052].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
**Pregnancy**&#13;
Results of animal research indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues and exert toxic effects on the developing fetus, manifested by retardation of skeletal development. The importance of this in humans is not known, however, doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women unless the benefit significantly outweighs the risk [F3052]. &#13;
&#13;
**Carcinogenicity**&#13;
In vivo studies conducted in rats and mice have not provided conclusive evidence that tetracyclines may be carcinogenic or that they affect fertility. In two mammalian cell lines, positive tests for mutagenicity occurred at concentrations of 60 and 10 mcg/ml respectively. In humans, no association between tetracyclines and these effects have been established [F3052].</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Doxycycline is metabolized in the liver and gastrointestinal tract and concentrated in bile [FDA label], [F3055].&#13;
Major metabolic pathways of doxycycline have not been identified, however, enzyme inducers have been found to decrease the half-life of doxycycline [F3055].&#13;
&#13;
</metabolism>
  <absorption>Tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins by varying degrees. Doxycycline is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. This drug is highly lipid soluble and has a low affinity for calcium binding [FDA label]. Absorption is not significantly affected by the concomitant ingestion of food or milk [F3052]. Peak serum levels of approximately 2.6 mcg/ml are reached at 2 hours following a 200 mg tablet oral dose [F3052].</absorption>
  <half-life>16.33 hr (± 4.53 sd) [FDA label].</half-life>
  <protein-binding>&gt;90% [FDA label], [F3055].</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Mainly the urine and feces as active and unchanged drug [FDA label]. Between 40% and 60% of an administered dose can be accounted for in the urine by 92 hours, and approximately 30% can be accounted for in the feces [F3055].</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution> Doxycycline diffuses readily into most body tissues, fluid and/or cavities and the volume of distribution has been measured as 0.7 L/kg [F3052].</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40% over 72 hours in individuals with normal kidney function (creatinine clearance approximately 75 mL/min). This rate may fall as low as 1-5% over 72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Some clinical studies have shown no major difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18-22 hours) in patients with normal and severely impaired renal function. Hemodialysis does not affect serum half-life of doxycycline [FDA label].&#13;

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <general-function>Sodium-independent organic anion transmembrane transporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Involved in the renal elimination of endogenous and exogenous organic anions. Functions as organic anion exchanger when the uptake of one molecule of organic anion is coupled with an efflux of one molecule of endogenous dicarboxylic acid (glutarate, ketoglutarate, etc). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) (By similarity). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of p-aminohippurate (PAH), ochratoxin (OTA), acyclovir (ACV), 3'-azido-3-'deoxythymidine (AZT), cimetidine (CMD), 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetate (2,4-D), hippurate (HA), indoleacetate (IA), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate (CMPF), cidofovir, adefovir, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine (PMEG), 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) diaminopurine (PMEDAP) and edaravone sulfate. PAH uptake is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulphonate (PCMBS), diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), sulindac, diclofenac, carprofen, glutarate and okadaic acid (By similarity). PAH uptake is inhibited by benzothiazolylcysteine (BTC), S-chlorotrifluoroethylcysteine (CTFC), cysteine S-conjugates S-dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC), furosemide, steviol, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore A23187, benzylpenicillin, furosemide, indomethacin, bumetamide, losartan, probenecid, phenol red, urate, and alpha-ketoglutarate.</specific-function>
