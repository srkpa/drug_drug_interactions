  <description>DTS-201 is a prodrug of doxorubicin, a widely used anti-cancer drug that Diatos intends to develop for the treatment of various solid tumors. It is activated in the tumor environment.&#13;
DTS-201 may be suitable for the treatment of many types of solid tumors, including tumors sensitive to doxorubicin and potentially other tumors which are not currently treated with doxorubicin but which express high levels of CD-10* or TOP** peptidases, such as prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer and some types of renal cancer.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>DTS-201 is a prodrug: it remains inactive while circulating in the blood stream and healthy tissues and does not enter cells. In the vicinity of tumors, extracellular enzymes overexpressed and oversecreted specifically in the tumor environment cleave DTS-201 to yield an intermediate, L-dox (leucyl doxorubicin), which is capable of penetrating cells. Once in the cell, intracellular peptidases release free doxorubicin which is then able to interact with its targets.</mechanism-of-action>
