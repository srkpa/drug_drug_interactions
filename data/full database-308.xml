  <name>Codeine</name>
  <description>The relief of pain (analgesia) is a primary goal for enhancing the quality of life of patients and for increasing the ability of patients to engage in day to day activities. Codeine, an opioid analgesic, was originally approved in the US in 1950 and is a drug used to decrease pain by increasing the threshold for pain without impairing consciousness or altering other sensory functions. Opiates such as codeine are derived from the poppy plant, _Papaver somniferum_ (Papaveraceae).[A175096]&#13;
&#13;
Codeine is utilized as a central analgesic, sedative, hypnotic, antinociceptive, and antiperistaltic agent, and is also recommended in certain diseases with incessant coughing.[LABEL,A175096]</description>

  <indication>Codeine sulfate is a form of this drug that is commonly used. It is available in tablet form [FDA label] and indicated for the relief of mild to moderately severe pain, where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
The solution form is used by itself or combined in a syrup with other drugs and is used as a cough suppressant in adults aged 18 and above [L5521], [L5524]. </indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>&#13;
**General effects**&#13;
&#13;
Codeine is a weak narcotic pain reliever and cough suppressant that is similar to morphine and hydrocodone. A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body. Codeine increases tolerance to pain, reducing existing discomfort. In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression [A175096]. &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
**Antitussive activity**&#13;
&#13;
This drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials [A175102] and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing [A175096]. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla [F3658].&#13;
&#13;
**Effects on intestinal motility**&#13;
&#13;
Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action [F3661]. This may possibly lead to constipation [F3658]. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease, particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
**Effects on the central nervous system**&#13;
&#13;
Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. Its primary site of action is at the _mu_ opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system. The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine [F3658]. Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of μ-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system [A175108].&#13;
&#13;
**Effects on blood pressure**&#13;
&#13;
This drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
**Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain**&#13;
&#13;
Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system. The average duration of action is about 4 hours [F3658].&#13;
&#13;
Regular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms [A175096], [A175105].</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Codeine is a selective agonist for the mu opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity to this receptor than morphine, a more potent opioid drug. Codeine binds to mu-opioid receptors, which are involved in the transmission of pain throughout the body and central nervous system [FDA label], [A175096]. The analgesic properties of codeine are thought to arise from its conversion to [Morphine], although the exact mechanism of analgesic action is unknown at this time [FDA label], [F3658].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>**Oral LD50**: 427 mg kg-1 (rat) [MSDS]. &#13;
&#13;
**Overdose/toxicity**&#13;
&#13;
Symptoms of opioid toxicity may include confusion, somnolence, shallow breathing, constricted pupils, nausea, vomiting, constipation and a lack of appetite. In severe cases, symptoms of circulatory and respiratory depression may ensue, which may be life-threatening or fatal [L5506], [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
**Teratogenic effects**&#13;
&#13;
This drug is classified as a pregnancy Category C drug. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies completed in pregnant women. Codeine should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk of the drug to the fetus [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
Codeine has shown embryolethal and fetotoxic effects in the hamster, rat as well as mouse models at about 2-4 times the maximum recommended human dose [FDA label]. Maternally toxic doses that were about 7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day, were associated with evidence of bone resorption and incomplete bone ossification. Codeine did not demonstrate evidence of embrytoxicity or fetotoxicity in the rabbit model at doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day based on a body surface area comparison [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
**Nonteratogenic effects**&#13;
&#13;
Neonatal codeine withdrawal has been observed in infants born to addicted and non-addicted mothers who ingested codeine-containing medications in the days before delivery. Common symptoms of narcotic withdrawal include irritability, excessive crying, tremors, hyperreflexia, seizures, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor feeding. These signs may be observed shortly following birth and may require specific treatment [FDA label]. &#13;
 &#13;
Codeine (30 mg/kg) given subcutaneously to pregnant rats during gestation and for 25 days after delivery increased the rate of neonatal mortality at birth. The dose given was 0.8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
**The use in breastfeeding/nursing**&#13;
&#13;
Codeine is secreted into human milk. The maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including death, in nursing infants [FDA label]. </toxicity>
  <metabolism>Approximately 70 to 80% of the ingested dose of codeine is metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glucuronic acid to _codeine-6­ glucuronide_ (C6G) and by O-demethylation to _morphine_ (about 5-10%) and N-demethylation to _norcodeine_ (about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major metabolic enzymes mediating the glucurodination of codeine to the metabolite, _codeine 6 glucuronide_. &#13;
&#13;
Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for the transformation of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the main enzyme mediating the conversion of codeine to _norcodeine_. Morphine and norcodeine are then further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are _morphine-3-glucuronide_ (M3G) and_ morphine-6-glucuronide _(M6G). Morphine and M6G have been proven to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is not known at this time. Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to have analgesic properties [FDA label]. </metabolism>
  <absorption>**Absorption**&#13;
&#13;
Codeine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The maximum plasma concentration occurs 60 minutes after administration [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
**Food Effects**&#13;
&#13;
When 60 mg codeine sulfate was given 30 minutes post-ingestion of a high high-calorie meal, there was no significant change in the absorption of codeine [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Steady-state concentration**&#13;
&#13;
The administration of 15 mg codeine sulfate every 4 hours for 5 days lead to steady-state concentrations of codeine, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) within 48 hours [FDA label]. &#13;
</absorption>
  <half-life>Plasma half-lives of codeine and its metabolites have been reported to be approximately 3 hours [FDA label]. </half-life>
  <protein-binding>7-25% bound to plasma proteins [FDA label]. </protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>About 90% of the total dose of codeine is excreted by the kidneys. Approximately 10% of the drug excreted by the kidneys is unchanged codeine [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
The majority of the excretion products can be found in the urine within 6 hours of ingestion, and 40-60 % of the codeine is excreted free or conjugated, approximately 5 to 15 percent as free and conjugated morphine, and approximately 10-20% free and conjugated norcodeine [F3658]. &#13;
</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>Apparent volume of distribution: about 3-6 L/kg, showing an extensive distribution of the drug into tissues [FDA label]. </volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>Renal clearance of codeine was 183 +/- 59 ml min-1 in a clinical study [A175099].&#13;
&#13;
Renal impairment may decrease codeine clearance [LABEL]. </clearance>

        <name>Mu-type opioid receptor</name>
        <general-function>Voltage-gated calcium channel activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl, etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins. The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation. Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects. Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity.</specific-function>

        <name>Kappa-type opioid receptor</name>
        <general-function>Opioid receptor activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>G-protein coupled opioid receptor that functions as receptor for endogenous alpha-neoendorphins and dynorphins, but has low affinity for beta-endorphins. Also functions as receptor for various synthetic opioids and for the psychoactive diterpene salvinorin A. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibits neurotransmitter release by reducing calcium ion currents and increasing potassium ion conductance. Plays a role in the perception of pain. Plays a role in mediating reduced physical activity upon treatment with synthetic opioids. Plays a role in the regulation of salivation in response to synthetic opioids. May play a role in arousal and regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>UDPGTs are of major importance in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. This isozyme is active on polyhydroxylated estrogens (such as estriol, 4-hydroxyestrone and 2-hydroxyestriol) and xenobiotics (such as 4-methylumbelliferone, 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-aminophenol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl and menthol). It is capable of 6 alpha-hydroxyglucuronidation of hyodeoxycholic acid.</specific-function>

        <general-function>Secondary active organic cation transmembrane transporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Translocates a broad array of organic cations with various structures and molecular weights including the model compounds 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), tetraethylammonium (TEA), N-1-methylnicotinamide (NMN), 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP), the endogenous compounds choline, guanidine, histamine, epinephrine, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine, and the drugs quinine, and metformin. The transport of organic cations is inhibited by a broad array of compounds like tetramethylammonium (TMA), cocaine, lidocaine, NMDA receptor antagonists, atropine, prazosin, cimetidine, TEA and NMN, guanidine, cimetidine, choline, procainamide, quinine, tetrabutylammonium, and tetrapentylammonium. Translocates organic cations in an electrogenic and pH-independent manner. Translocates organic cations across the plasma membrane in both directions. Transports the polyamines spermine and spermidine. Transports pramipexole across the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubular epithelial cells. The choline transport is activated by MMTS. Regulated by various intracellular signaling pathways including inhibition by protein kinase A activation, and endogenously activation by the calmodulin complex, the calmodulin-dependent kinase II and LCK tyrosine kinase.</specific-function>
