  <description>ILY101 is a metal-free, non-absorbed polymeric drug designed for the selective binding and removal of phosphate anions from the gastrointestinal tract.  ILY101 is being developed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis and works by reducing the systemic absorption of dietary phosphate.  ILY101 is designed to allow for lower daily doses and improved patient acceptance and tolerability in comparison to other products in this class of drugs.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>ILY101 binds dietary phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating excretion of phosphorus into feces. It is therefore anticipated to ameliorate hyperphosphatemia&#13;
by reducing the absorption of dietary phosphate.  Due to its low swelling rate after fluid absorption, less gastrointestinal adverse events, including constipation, flatulence and upper abdominal pain, are expected. Strong phosphorus binding capacity may result in the reduced number of tablets and improved compliance.&#13;
