  <pharmacodynamics>NX-1207 is an investigational new drug for BPH, whose chemical entity and mechanism of action remain undisclosed. BPH is a common disorder of older men, afflicting approximately half of men over age 50 and close to 90% of men by age 80. The disorder causes difficulties with urination associated with aging, such as urination at night, urge to void frequently, hesitancy, weak stream, and other problems.</pharmacodynamics>
