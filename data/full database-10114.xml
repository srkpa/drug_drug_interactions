  <name>Lorlatinib</name>
  <description>Lorlatinib has been used in trials studying the basic science and treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and ROS1-positive NSCLC. Despite initial responses from the use of various ALK inhibitors, however, it is virtually almost guaranteed that all patients with the condition in question will develop tumour progression or resistance to the current therapy in use [A40086].&#13;
&#13;
Considered a third-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, lorlatinib's most optimal place in the treatment sequence of this condition has most recently been identified with its latest approval by the US FDA in November of 2018 for the indication of treating those patients' disease which has progressed even after the use of first and second-generation TKIs like crizotinib, alectinib, or ceritinib [L4848, FDA Label]. Loratinib's ability to move past the blood-brain barrier facilitates its ability to treat progressive or worsening brain metastases as well [L4848, A40078].</description>

  <indication>Lorlatinib is a third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) [L4848] indicated for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on a) the prior use of crizotinib and at least one other ALK inhibitor for metastatic disease, or b) the prior use of alectinib as the first ALK inhibitor therapy for metastatic disease, or c) the prior use of certinib as the first ALK inhibitor therapy for metastatic disease [L848, FDA Label]. </indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Based on data from Study B7461001, exposure-response relationships for Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia and for any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction were observed at steady-state exposures achieved at the recommended dosage, with higher probability of the occurrence of adverse reactions with increasing lorlatinib exposure [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
In 295 patients who received lorlatinib at the recommended dosage of 100 mg once daily and had an ECG measurement in the same Study B7461001, the maximum mean change from baseline for their PR interval was 16.4 ms (2-sided 90% upper confidence interval [CI] 19.4 ms) [FDA Label]. Among the 284 patients with PR interval &lt;200 ms at baseline, 14% had PR interval prolongation ≥200 ms after starting use with lorlatinib [FDA Label]. The prolongation of PR interval occurred in a concentration-dependent manner and atrioventricular block occurred in 1% of patients [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Finally, in 275 patients who received lorlatinib at the recommended dosage in the activity-estimating portion of Study B7461001, no large mean increases from baseline in the QTcF interval (i.e., &gt;20 ms) were detected [FDA Label].  </pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for up to 85% of lung cancer cases worldwide and remains a particularly difficult to treat condition [L4848]. The gene rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a genetic alteration that drives the development of NSCLC in a number of patients [A40079, A40080]. Ordinarily, ALK is a natural endogenous tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an important role in the development of the brain and elicits activity on various specific neurons in the nervous system [A40075, A40078, A40079].&#13;
&#13;
Subsequnetly, lorlatinib is a kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and number of other tyrosine kinase receptor related targets including ROS1, TYK1, FER, FPS, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, FAK, FAK2, and ACK [FDA Label]. Lorlatinib demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors [FDA Label]. Moreover, lorlatinib possesses the capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to reach and treat progressive or worsening brain metastases as well [L4848, A40078]. The overall antitumor activity of lorlatinib in in-vivo models appears to be dose-dependent and correlated with the inhibition of ALK phosphorylation [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Although many ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients respond to initial tyrosine kinase therapies, such patients also often experience tumor progression [A40081]. Various clinical trials performed with lorlatinib, however, have demonstrated its utility  to effect tumor regression in ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients who experience tumor progression despite current use or having already used various first and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors like crizotinib, alectinib, or ceritinib [A40086].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>Although there is no formal data available on the use of lorlatinib in pregnant women, based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, it is believed that lorlatinib can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
There are no data on the presence of lorlatinib or its metabolites in either human or animal milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production [FDA Label]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, instruct women not to breastfeed during treatment with lorlatinib and for 7 days after the final dose [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with lorlatinib and for at least 6 months after the final dose [FDA Label]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use a non-hormonal method of contraception, because lorlatinib can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with lorlatinib and for at least 3 months after the final dose [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Based on findings from animal studies, use of lorlatinib may transiently impair male fertility [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
The safety and effectiveness of lorlatinib in pediatric patients have not been established [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Of the 295 patients in Study B7461001 who received 100 mg lorlatinib orally once daily, 18% of patients were aged 65 years or older [FDA Label]. Although data are limited, no clinically important differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients aged 65 years or older and younger patients [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN] with AST &gt; ULN or total bilirubin &gt;1 to 1.5 × ULN with any AST) [FDA Label]. The recommended dose of lorlatinib has not been established for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [FDA Label]. &#13;
&#13;
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) [FDA Label]. The recommended dose of lorlatinib has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lorlatinib [FDA Label]. Lorlatinib was aneugenic in an in vitro assay in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and positive for micronuclei formation in vivo in the bone marrow of rats. Lorlatinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Dedicated fertility studies were not conducted with lorlatinib [FDA Label]. Findings in male reproductive organs occurred in repeat-dose toxicity studies and included lower testicular, epididymal, and prostate weights; testicular tubular degeneration/atrophy; prostatic atrophy; and/or epididymal inflammation at 15 mg/kg/day and 7 mg/kg/day in rats and dogs, respectively (approximately 8 and 2 times, respectively, the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg based on AUC) [FDA Label]. The effects on male reproductive organs were reversible [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Distended abdomen, skin rash, and increased cholesterol and triglycerides occurred in animals [FDA Label]. These findings were accompanied by hyperplasia and dilation of the bile ducts in the liver and acinar atrophy of the pancreas in rats at 15 mg/kg/day and in dogs at 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 and 0.5 times, respectively, the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg based on AUC) [FDA Label]. All effects were reversible within the recovery period [FDA Label]. </toxicity>
  <metabolism>In vitro, lorlatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4, with minor contribution from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and UGT1A3 [FDA Label]. In plasma, a benzoic acid metabolite (M8) of lorlatinib resulting from the oxidative cleavage of the amide and aromatic ether bonds of lorlatinib accounted for 21% of the circulating radioactivity in a human [14C] mass balance study [FDA Label]. The oxidative cleavage metabolite, M8, is pharmacologically inactive [FDA Label].</metabolism>
  <absorption>The median lorlatinib Tmax was 1.2 hours (0.5 to 4 hours) following a single oral 100 mg dose and 2 hours (0.5 to 23 hours) following 100 mg orally once daily at steady state [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
The mean absolute bioavailability is 81% (90% CI 75.7%, 86.2%) after oral administration compared to intravenous administration [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Administration of lorlatinib with a high fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories with 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 to 600 calories from fat) had no clinically meaningful effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics [FDA Label].  </absorption>
  <half-life>The mean plasma half-life (t½) of lorlatinib was 24 hours (40%) after a single oral 100 mg dose of lorlatinib [FDA Label].</half-life>
  <protein-binding>In vitro, lorlatinib was 66% bound to plasma proteins at a concentration of 2.4 µM [FDA Label]. The blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.99 [FDA Label].</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Following a single oral 100 mg dose of radiolabeled lorlatinib, 48% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine (&lt;1% as unchanged) and 41% in feces (about 9% as unchanged) [FDA Label]. </route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The mean (CV%) steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 305 L (28%) following a single intravenous dose [FDA Label]. </volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The mean oral clearance (CL/F) was 11 L/h (35%) following a single oral 100 mg dose and increased to 18 L/h (39%) at steady state, suggesting autoinduction [FDA Label].</clearance>

        <name>ALK tyrosine kinase receptor</name>
        <general-function>Transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Neuronal orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that is essentially and transiently expressed in specific regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems and plays an important role in the genesis and differentiation of the nervous system. Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>
