  <description>Peptimmuneâ€™s lead product GT 389-255, is a novel lipase inhibitor and fat binding hydrogel polymer conjugate for the treatment of obesity which has completed single and multiple ascending dose (SAD and MAD) Phase I trials. It is expected to block fat absorption with fewer side effects than currently marketed lipase inhibitors.&#13;

  <mechanism-of-action>GT 389-255 is a novel conjugate of a proprietary pancreatic lipase inhibitor and a fatbinding hydrogel polymer for the treatment of obesity. GT 389-255 is a novel conjugate of a proprietary pancreatic lipase inhibitor and a fat binding hydrogel polymer for the treatment of obesity. It acts within the gastro-intestinal tract to prevent fat digestion and is expected to inhibit &gt; 30% of fat absorption. The novel conjugate is expected to have fewer side-effects than currently marketed therapies. The currently marketed pancreatic lipase inhibitor Orlistat, is associated with oily incontinence, caused by mal-absorbed triglycerides. GT 389-255 is expected to have minimal systemic exposure. Less than 1% of the lipase inhibitor is absorbed and the fat binding polymer is not absorbed.</mechanism-of-action>
