  <name>Rucaparib</name>
  <description>Rucaparib is a potent mammalian poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, 2 and 3 inhibitor with anticancer properties. PPAR is an enzyme that plays an essential role in DNA repair by activating response pathways and facilitating repair [A18745], and defects in these repair mechanisms have been demonstrated in various malignancies, including cancer. Regulation of repair pathways is critical in promoting necessary cell death. BRCA genes are tumor suppressor genes mediate several cellular process including DNA replication, transcription regulation, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, chromatin structuring and homologous recombination (HR). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), along with PPAR inhibition, is a vulnerability that enhances the cell death pathway when the single mutations alone would permit viability. Ovarian cancer commonly possesses defects in DNA repair pathways such as HRD due to BRCA mutations or otherwise. &#13;
&#13;
There are three main types of ovarian cancer: epithelial (90%), germ cell (5%) and sex cord stromal cell (5%). Epithelial ovarian, being the most common, fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States. Advanced ovarian cancer particularly poses challenges due to reduced therapeutic response rates from standard platinum-based chemotherapy and overall survival rates. Rucaparib has shown to induce cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes [FDA Label]. Of all the BRCA1/2 mutations in ovarian cancer, most are due to germline mutations (18%), and approximately 7% represent somatic mutations acquired within the tumor [A31354].&#13;
&#13;
The indication of rucaparib as an oral monotherapy in patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer was granted accelerated approval in 2016 for selected patients who have previously received greater than two lines of platinum-based therapy. It is currently marketed in the US under the brand name Rubraca that contains rucaparib camsylate as the active ingredient. The identification of patients who are eligible for rucaparib therapy is performed via *in vitro* diagnostic tests to detect the presence of a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic). The FDA-approved test qualitatively detects sequence alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) genes. More information can be found on the FDA Website [L1047].&#13;
&#13;
While rucaparib is indicated for deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated advanced ovarian cancer, there is evidence that its antitumor activity is also clinically effective against ovarian tumors with high homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) [A31354].</description>

  <indication>Indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for rucaparib.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Rucaparib has been shown to decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer with or without deficiencies in BRCA [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
The effect of multiple doses of rucaparib on QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label single-arm study in 56 patients with solid tumors who were administered continuous doses of rucaparib ranging from 40 mg once daily (0.03 times the approved recommended dosage) to 840 mg twice daily (1.4 times the approved recommended dosage). The mean QTcF increase from baseline (90% confidence interval [CI]) in population pharmacokinetics estimated 95% percentile Cmax (3019 ng/mL) at steady state of 600 mg rucaparib twice daily was 14.9 msec (11.1-18.7 msec) [FDA Label]. </pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes play a role in DNA repair. PPAR-1 is responsible in repairing single stranded breaks (SSBs) in base excision repair (BER). PARP1 also functions in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) regulation, chromatin remodeling and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways [A18745]. When PARP is inhibited, single-strand breaks become double-strand breaks, which are typically repaired via homologous recombination [A18745]. Pre-existing homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may occur through mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which confers persistant cell repair and growth in cancer cells. &#13;
&#13;
Rucaparib is an inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3. Via an inhibitory effect on the PARP enzymatic activity, rucaparib decreases the formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell death [FDA Label]. It is proposed that PARP inhibition specifically targets tumor cells with preexisting HRD, such as those cells possessing mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes [A31354]. Rucaparib induces synthetic lethality by disrupting ingle- and double-strand repair pathways leading to tumor cell death. It is also suggested that PARP inhibition can lead to trapping of PARP-1 enzyme on damaged DNA, effectively preventing continuation of the DNA repair process; defective BRCA1 recruitment to damaged DNA; and activation of alternative DNA repair such as error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative end joining pathways leading to mutations or chromosomal changes and ultimately cell death [A31354].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>According to a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test, rucaparib has shown to be mutagenic. It was also clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes. Rucaparib has a genotoxic potential. Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, rucaparib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Female patients of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of rucaparib [FDA Label]. </toxicity>
  <metabolism>According to *in vitro* studies, rucaparib is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 [FDA Label]. </metabolism>
  <absorption>Rucaparib demonstrates a linear pharmacokinetic properties over a dose range from 240 to 840 mg twice daily with time-independence and dose-proportionality. The mean steady-state rucaparib Cmax was 1940 ng/mL (54% coefficient of variation [CV]) and AUC0-12h was 16900 h⋅ng/mL (54% CV) at the approved recommended dosage. The time to reach the steady-state peak plasma concentration (Tmax) was 1.9 hours at the recommended dosage. &#13;
The mean absolute bioavailability of rucaparib immediate-release tablet was 36% with a range from 30% to 45%. Following a high-fat meal, the Cmax was increased by 20% and AUC 0-24h was increased by 38%, and T max was delayed by 2.5 hours, as compared to dosing under fasted conditions [FDA Label]. </absorption>
  <half-life>Following a single oral dose of 600mg rucaparib, the mean terminal half life (t1/2) was 17-19 hours [FDA Label].</half-life>
  <protein-binding>In vitro, the protein binding of rucaparib was 70% in human plasma at therapeutic concentrations. Rucaparib preferentially distributed to red blood cells with a blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 1.83 [FDA Label]. </protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Fecal excretion was the major route of elimination, accounting for ≥ 79% of the total dose.</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>Following a single intravenous dose of 12mg to 40mg rucaparib, the steady-state volume of distribution was 113L to 262L [FDA Label].</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>Following continuous 600mg rucaparib administration orally twice daily, the apparent clearance ranges from 15.3 to 79.2 L/hour. The clearance ranged from 13.9 to 18.4 L/hour, following a single intravenous dose of rucaparib 12 mg to 40 mg [FDA Label]. </clearance>

        <specific-function>Involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, by catalyzing the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of a limited number of acceptor proteins involved in chromatin architecture and in DNA metabolism. This modification follows DNA damages and appears as an obligatory step in a detection/signaling pathway leading to the reparation of DNA strand breaks. Mediates the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of APLF and CHFR. Positively regulates the transcription of MTUS1 and negatively regulates the transcription of MTUS2/TIP150. With EEF1A1 and TXK, forms a complex that acts as a T-helper 1 (Th1) cell-specific transcription factor and binds the promoter of IFN-gamma to directly regulate its transcription, and is thus involved importantly in Th1 cytokine production. Required for PARP9 and DTX3L recruitment to DNA damage sites. PARP1-dependent PARP9-DTX3L-mediated ubiquitination promotes the rapid and specific recruitment of 53BP1/TP53BP1, UIMC1/RAP80, and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Most active in catalyzing 2-hydroxylation. Caffeine is metabolized primarily by cytochrome CYP1A2 in the liver through an initial N3-demethylation. Also acts in the metabolism of aflatoxin B1 and acetaminophen. Participates in the bioactivation of carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Catalizes the N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines and the O-deethylation of phenacetin.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. This enzyme contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>UDPGT is of major importance in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. This isoform glucuronidates bilirubin IX-alpha to form both the IX-alpha-C8 and IX-alpha-C12 monoconjugates and diconjugate. Is also able to catalyze the glucuronidation of 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinylestradiol, 1-hydroxypyrene, 4-methylumbelliferone, 1-naphthol, paranitrophenol, scopoletin, and umbelliferone. Isoform 2 lacks transferase activity but acts as a negative regulator of isoform 1.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>High-capacity urate exporter functioning in both renal and extrarenal urate excretion. Plays a role in porphyrin homeostasis as it is able to mediates the export of protoporhyrin IX (PPIX) both from mitochondria to cytosol and from cytosol to extracellular space, and cellular export of hemin, and heme. Xenobiotic transporter that may play an important role in the exclusion of xenobiotics from the brain. Appears to play a major role in the multidrug resistance phenotype of several cancer cell lines. Implicated in the efflux of numerous drugs and xenobiotics: mitoxantrone, the photosensitizer pheophorbide, camptothecin, methotrexate, azidothymidine (AZT), and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin.</specific-function>

        <name>Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1</name>
        <general-function>Monovalent cation:proton antiporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Solute transporter for tetraethylammonium (TEA), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), cimetidine, N-methylnicotinamide (NMN), metformin, creatinine, guanidine, procainamide, topotecan, estrone sulfate, acyclovir, ganciclovir and also the zwitterionic cephalosporin, cephalexin and cephradin. Seems to also play a role in the uptake of oxaliplatin (a new platinum anticancer agent). Able to transport paraquat (PQ or N,N-dimethyl-4-4'-bipiridinium); a widely used herbicid. Responsible for the secretion of cationic drugs across the brush border membranes.</specific-function>

        <name>Solute carrier family 22 member 1</name>
        <general-function>Secondary active organic cation transmembrane transporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Translocates a broad array of organic cations with various structures and molecular weights including the model compounds 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), tetraethylammonium (TEA), N-1-methylnicotinamide (NMN), 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP), the endogenous compounds choline, guanidine, histamine, epinephrine, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine, and the drugs quinine, and metformin. The transport of organic cations is inhibited by a broad array of compounds like tetramethylammonium (TMA), cocaine, lidocaine, NMDA receptor antagonists, atropine, prazosin, cimetidine, TEA and NMN, guanidine, cimetidine, choline, procainamide, quinine, tetrabutylammonium, and tetrapentylammonium. Translocates organic cations in an electrogenic and pH-independent manner. Translocates organic cations across the plasma membrane in both directions. Transports the polyamines spermine and spermidine. Transports pramipexole across the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubular epithelial cells. The choline transport is activated by MMTS. Regulated by various intracellular signaling pathways including inhibition by protein kinase A activation, and endogenously activation by the calmodulin complex, the calmodulin-dependent kinase II and LCK tyrosine kinase.</specific-function>

        <general-function>Sodium-independent organic anion transmembrane transporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Involved in the renal elimination of endogenous and exogenous organic anions. Functions as organic anion exchanger when the uptake of one molecule of organic anion is coupled with an efflux of one molecule of endogenous dicarboxylic acid (glutarate, ketoglutarate, etc). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) (By similarity). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of p-aminohippurate (PAH), ochratoxin (OTA), acyclovir (ACV), 3'-azido-3-'deoxythymidine (AZT), cimetidine (CMD), 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetate (2,4-D), hippurate (HA), indoleacetate (IA), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate (CMPF), cidofovir, adefovir, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine (PMEG), 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) diaminopurine (PMEDAP) and edaravone sulfate. PAH uptake is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulphonate (PCMBS), diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), sulindac, diclofenac, carprofen, glutarate and okadaic acid (By similarity). PAH uptake is inhibited by benzothiazolylcysteine (BTC), S-chlorotrifluoroethylcysteine (CTFC), cysteine S-conjugates S-dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC), furosemide, steviol, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore A23187, benzylpenicillin, furosemide, indomethacin, bumetamide, losartan, probenecid, phenol red, urate, and alpha-ketoglutarate.</specific-function>
