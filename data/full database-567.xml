  <name>Lactulose</name>
  <description>Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that is most commonly used as a laxative agent despite also being formally indicated to serve as an adjunct therapy in treating portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Despite being first synthesized in 1929[A178081], investigations regarding its possible use as a laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation did not occur until the 1960s and its first clinical use for treating PSE was not until 1966.[L6202] &#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, although lactulose received formal FDA approval in 1977 and has since become a readily available generic and brand-name non-prescription medication listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines employed in a health system[L6205], data regarding its optimal place in therapy is often ambiguous.[L6202]&#13;
&#13;
Especially considering the use of lactulose as a laxative is typically only considered after lifestyle and dietary modifications fail and the fact that lactulose therapy cannot be ethically withheld from patients diagnosed with PSE in a placebo study, the substance may just be one of many options available for treating constipation and its efficacy in managing PSE may never be formally confirmed or refuted via clinical investigation.[L6202]</description>

  <indication>Lactulose is indicated for use as a laxative in the treatment of chronic constipation in adults and geriatric patients.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]&#13;
&#13;
Additionally, lactulose is also employed as an adjunct to protein restriction and supportive therapy for the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), including both the hepatic pre-coma and coma variations.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, lactulose solution has been effective at managing PSE resulting from surgical portacaval shunts or from chronic hepatic diseases like cirrhosis.[L6199]&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]   </pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>It has been documented that the oral LD50 of lactulose is 48.8 mL/kg in mice and more than 30 mL/ kg in rats.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]&#13;
&#13;
It is expected that overdosage with lactulose would result in abdominal cramps and diarrhea, both of which should be treated with fluid and electrolyte replacement as required.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]&#13;
&#13;
Considering the use of lactulose during pregnancy in humans has not been formally investigated, the agent should only be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Similarly, it is unknown whether lactulose is distributed into human breastmilk.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Use of the medication in nursing women should subsequently be undertaken with caution.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]&#13;
&#13;
Reproduction studies in rats, mice, and rabbits have not revealed any evidence of impaired fertility as a result of administering lactulose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]&#13;
&#13;
Data regarding the safety and efficacy of using lactulose in children for the treatment of chronic constipation or portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is either very limited or yet to be established.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]&#13;
&#13;
Information regarding the long-term mutagenic potential of lactulose solution in animals or humans and about the long-term carcinogenic potential in humans are not available.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Lactulose is essentially only metabolized in the colon by saccharolytic bacteria that are present there.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, the substance is broken down into lactic acid and small amounts of acetic and formic acid.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Specific examples of bacteria that normally inhabit the large intestine that are capable of lactulose metabolism include Lactobacilli, Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, and Clostridia.[L6199]</metabolism>
  <absorption>After administration by the oral route, less than 3% of the given dose of lactulose solution is absorbed by the small intestine.[L6199] The remaining unabsorbed lactulose reaches the large intestine where it is metabolized - but even then, negligible quantities of unchanged lactulose or its metabolites are absorbed across the colon.[L6199,L6202]</absorption>
  <half-life>The data regarding the half-life of lactulose is not readily available or accessible.</half-life>
  <protein-binding>Negligible amounts of lactulose - metabolized or non-metabolized - are absorbed into the body.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Regardless, data regarding the protein binding of lactulose is not readily available or accessible.</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>The renal excretion of any lactulose that manages to be absorbed into the circulation has been determined to be 3% or less and is generally complete within 24 hours.[FDA Label] Any unabsorbed lactulose is largely excreted with stool.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>Negligible amounts of lactulose - metabolized or non-metabolized - are absorbed into the body.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Most lactulose that is administered subsequently remains predominantly around the gastrointestinal tract area.</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>Negligible amounts of lactulose - metabolized or non-metabolized - are absorbed into the body.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Regardless, data regarding the clearance of lactulose is not readily available or accessible.</clearance>
