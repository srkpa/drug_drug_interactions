  <description>AX200, which has been developed for the treatment of stroke, is the most advanced drug candidate and is halfway through the process of gaining clinical approval. The expression of the endogenous AX200 protein in the brain is increased after brain damage. Thus, if this drug administered in the acute phase of stroke, the brain’s own protective action is supported. And this is where the double neurotherapeutic approach is most beneficial: AX200 stops neuronal cell death in the acute phase of stroke, while stimulating simultaneously the regeneration of nervous tissue through the induction of neuro- and arteriogenesis and supporting the reorganisation of the nervous system.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>The AX200 protein is produced at highly elevated levels in&#13;
the brain, as part of an endogenous protective mechanism after brain damage. Thus, if this drug administered in the acute phase of stroke, the brain’s own protective action is further boosted. This offers a highly beneficial, dual neurotherapeutic approach which has been discovered by SYGNIS. AX200 stops neuronal cell death in the acute phase of stroke, and in addition, it stimulates the regeneration of the already damaged nervous tissue through the induction of new nerve cells and blood vessels and the reorganisation of neuronal networks.</mechanism-of-action>
