  <description>Duvelisib, also known as IPI-145 and INK-1197, is a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinases that was designed initially to prove that simultaneous inhibition of the isoforms delta and gamma can produce a broad adaptative and innate immune cell inhibitory activity. All the work around duvelisib showed that this agent is a potent inhibitor of both forms.[A39025] Duvelisib was developed by Verastem, Inc and FDA approved on September 24, 2018.[L4585]</description>

  <indication>Duvelisib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) after at least two prior therapies.[L4586]&#13;
&#13;
The CLL is a cancer of the blood stem cells which are the blood cells that can develop into different types of cells. In leukemia, there is an overproduction of cells that are abnormal and do not mature into blood cells and thus, they just crowd out normal cells and impair their normal function. In lymphocyte leukemia, the abnormal cell growth is observed in the lymphoid cells which are the type of blood cells that mature into lymphocytes. The CLL is the type of lymphocytic leukemia that develops slowly over months or years.[L4587] The SLL is a very similar disease to the CLL and these terms are usually referred interchangeably. The only difference between these two diseases is that in CLL the cells are found mostly in the blood and bone marrow while in SLL, the cells are mainly found in the lymph nodes.[L4588]&#13;
&#13;
As well, duvelisib obtained an accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least two prior systemic therapies. This approval is still under the status of continued approval and it is restrained to confirmatory trials.[L4586]&#13;
&#13;
The follicular lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma that clusters in the lymph nodes or other tissues.[L4589]</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Preclinical data showed that duvelisib presents cytotoxic actions at micromolar doses and antagonizes the activation of downstream signaling even in the presence of the mutation BTK C481S, which allows for the treatment of patients resistant to ibrutinib.[A39032]&#13;
&#13;
In clinical trials, duvelisib was compared to ofatumumab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic leukemia. This trials reported a median progression-free survival of 16.4 months and an overall response rate of 78% which were almost 2-fold what it was reported for ofatumumab.[L4585]&#13;
&#13;
In clinical trials of follicular lymphoma, duvelisib presented and overall response rate of 42% from which almost all the patients observed a partial response. Of the responding patients, 43% maintained the response for at least 6 months and 17% for at least 12 months.[L4585]</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Duvelisib acts as a strong reversible inhibitor of the isoform gamma and delta of the phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K).[A39028]  PI3K plays a very important role in innate and adaptative immunity and the inhibition of the form delta and gamma has been very important for the suppression of immunity.[A39031]&#13;
&#13;
The activity of PI3K gamma and delta is restricted to hematopoietic cells and it is necessary for normal B cell development. In lymphomas, the activation of PI3K is enlarged to promote unlimited growth and survival. Hence, inhibition of PI3K can provide an inhibition of the signaling from BCR, inhibition of a cytokine signaling from the microenvironment and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity.[A39032] The specific mechanism of this PI3K inhibitors are further described as follows:&#13;
&#13;
-BCR activates signaling pathways after antigen engagement and it is also critical for the physiologic life of the lymphocytes and neoplastic lymphomas. In CLL, BCR reacts to auto- and exo-antigens to promote clonal expansion. This sustained presence of BCR activates delta PI3K producing a pro-survival pathway of the neoplastic cells which already present a higher activity of PI3K. Thus, the blockade of PI3K will limit the activity of BCR and the driven physiology of the lymphoma.[A39032]&#13;
&#13;
-The inhibition of PI3K can also inhibit paracrine and autocrine pro-survival signals mediated by adhesion molecules, chemokines and soluble factors. This activity is attained due to the fact that several downstream signals convey on PI3K.[A39034]&#13;
&#13;
-It has been reported that inactivation of PI3K produces a significant resistance to tumorigenesis. This data suggests that inhibition of PI3K can facilitate recognition and elimination of tumor cells.[A39032]&#13;
&#13;
In summary, duvelisib inhibits the isoform delta of PI3K which is necessary for cell proliferation and survival and the isoform gamma which is critical for cytokine signaling and the pro-inflammatory response.[A39034]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>Carcinogenic studies have not been performed and duvelisib did not produce any genetic damage in vitro or in vivo. In the case of fertility studies, there was found some histological abnormalities in male and female rats such as seminiferous epithelial atrophy, decreased testes weight, soft testes, small epididymis, oligo/aspermia, decreased ovary weight, and uterine atrophy.[FDA label]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Duvelesib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4.[FDA label]</metabolism>
  <absorption>Duvelisib is rapidly absorbed and its peak plasma concentration is reached 1-2 hours after initial administration with a bioavailability of 42% and with a minimal accumulation whose rate ranges between 1.5 and 2.9.[A39034] The maximal plasma concentration is reported to range in between 471 to 3294 ng/ml with a systemic exposure ranging from 2001 to 19059 ng.h/ml. Changes in the administered dose produce correspondent changes in all absorption parameters indicating a dose-response profile.[A39035]</absorption>
  <half-life>The reported half-life of duvelisib is in the range of 5.2 to 10.9 hours.[A39035]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>The protein binding of duvelisib is greater than 98% and this level is not dependent on serum concentration. It is reported that duvelisib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP.[FDA label]</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Duvelisib is eliminated after 3.5-9.5 hours when administered as a single dose and after 6.5-11.7 hours when given in multiple doses.[A39034] From the administered dose, 79% os excreted in feces and 14% in urine. About 10% of the total administered dose is secreted unchanged.[FDA label]</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The volume of distribution of duvelisib ranges from 26 to 102 L.[A39035]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>Duvelisib clearance rate is reported to be in the range of 3.6 to 11.2 L/h.[A39035]</clearance>

        <name>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma isoform</name>
        <general-function>Protein serine/threonine kinase activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) that phosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain-containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Links G-protein coupled receptor activation to PIP3 production. Involved in immune, inflammatory and allergic responses. Modulates leukocyte chemotaxis to inflammatory sites and in response to chemoattractant agents. May control leukocyte polarization and migration by regulating the spatial accumulation of PIP3 and by regulating the organization of F-actin formation and integrin-based adhesion at the leading edge. Controls motility of dendritic cells. Together with PIK3CD is involved in natural killer (NK) cell development and migration towards the sites of inflammation. Participates in T-lymphocyte migration. Regulates T-lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. Together with PIK3CD participates in T-lymphocyte development. Required for B-lymphocyte development and signaling. Together with PIK3CD participates in neutrophil respiratory burst. Together with PIK3CD is involved in neutrophil chemotaxis and extravasation. Together with PIK3CB promotes platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Regulates alpha-IIb/beta-3 integrins (ITGA2B/ ITGB3) adhesive function in platelets downstream of P2Y12 through a lipid kinase activity-independent mechanism. May have also a lipid kinase activity-dependent function in platelet aggregation. Involved in endothelial progenitor cell migration. Negative regulator of cardiac contractility. Modulates cardiac contractility by anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) and PDE3B activation, reducing cAMP levels. Regulates cardiac contractility also by promoting beta-adrenergic receptor internalization by binding to ADRBK1 and by non-muscle tropomyosin phosphorylation. Also has serine/threonine protein kinase activity: both lipid and protein kinase activities are required for beta-adrenergic receptor endocytosis. May also have a scaffolding role in modulating cardiac contractility. Contributes to cardiac hypertrophy under pathological stress. Through simultaneous binding of PDE3B to RAPGEF3 and PIK3R6 is assembled in a signaling complex in which the PI3K gamma complex is activated by RAPGEF3 and which is involved in angiogenesis.</specific-function>

        <name>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta isoform</name>
        <general-function>Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) that phosphorylates PftdIns(4,5)P2 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain-containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Mediates immune responses. Plays a role in B-cell development, proliferation, migration, and function. Required for B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Mediates B-cell proliferation response to anti-IgM, anti-CD40 and IL4 stimulation. Promotes cytokine production in response to TLR4 and TLR9. Required for antibody class switch mediated by TLR9. Involved in the antigen presentation function of B-cells. Involved in B-cell chemotaxis in response to CXCL13 and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Required for proliferation, signaling and cytokine production of naive, effector and memory T-cells. Required for T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Mediates TCR signaling events at the immune synapse. Activation by TCR leads to antigen-dependent memory T-cell migration and retention to antigenic tissues. Together with PIK3CG participates in T-cell development. Contributes to T-helper cell expansion and differentiation. Required for T-cell migration mediated by homing receptors SELL/CD62L, CCR7 and S1PR1 and antigen dependent recruitment of T-cells. Together with PIK3CG is involved in natural killer (NK) cell development and migration towards the sites of inflammation. Participates in NK cell receptor activation. Have a role in NK cell maturation and cytokine production. Together with PIK3CG is involved in neutrophil chemotaxis and extravasation. Together with PIK3CG participates in neutrophil respiratory burst. Have important roles in mast-cell development and mast cell mediated allergic response. Involved in stem cell factor (SCF)-mediated proliferation, adhesion and migration. Required for allergen-IgE-induced degranulation and cytokine release. The lipid kinase activity is required for its biological function. Isoform 2 may be involved in stabilizing total RAS levels, resulting in increased ERK phosphorylation and increased PI3K activity.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>High-capacity urate exporter functioning in both renal and extrarenal urate excretion. Plays a role in porphyrin homeostasis as it is able to mediates the export of protoporhyrin IX (PPIX) both from mitochondria to cytosol and from cytosol to extracellular space, and cellular export of hemin, and heme. Xenobiotic transporter that may play an important role in the exclusion of xenobiotics from the brain. Appears to play a major role in the multidrug resistance phenotype of several cancer cell lines. Implicated in the efflux of numerous drugs and xenobiotics: mitoxantrone, the photosensitizer pheophorbide, camptothecin, methotrexate, azidothymidine (AZT), and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin.</specific-function>
