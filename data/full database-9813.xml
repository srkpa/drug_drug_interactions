  <name>Esketamine</name>
  <description>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant cause of disability worldwide and the most common illness preceding suicide [L5596], [A175462]. On March 5, 2019, the nasal spray drug, _esketamine_, also known as _Spravato_ (by Janssen Pharmaceuticals), was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depression. &#13;
&#13;
Esketamine is the s-enantiomer of [Ketamine]. Ketamine is a mixture of two enantiomers (mirror image molecules). This is the first time that the FDA has approved esketamine for any use. The FDA approved ketamine (Ketalar) in 1970 [L5593].&#13;
&#13;
Esketamine may prove to be a promising treatment for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder who have not experienced an improvement in symptoms despite treatment with various medications and therapies. The intranasal route of administration for this drug allows for easy administration and a fast onset of action, which sets it apart from many other antidepressant agents that may take several weeks to take effect.</description>

  <indication>This drug is indicated in conjunction with an oral antidepressant for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
Note: Esketamine is not approved as an anesthetic agent. The safety and effectiveness of esketamine as an anesthetic agent have not been established to this date [FDA label]. </indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>**General effects**&#13;
&#13;
Esketamine is considered a central nervous system (CNS) depressant agent. It may cause sedation, dizziness, and lethargy, among other symptoms [FDA Label]. This drug has dissociative and antidepressant properties [FDA label]. Acutely, esketamine may impair attention, judgment, thinking, reaction speed, and motor skills. Two placebo-controlled studies were performed to evaluate the effects of ketamine on the ability to drive. The effects of esketamine 84 mg were comparable to placebo at 6 hours and 18 hours post ingestion [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
**Effects on cardiac electrophysiology**&#13;
&#13;
The effect of esketamine (84 mg nasal spray and 0.8 mg/kg esketamine intravenously infused over 40 minutes) on the QTc interval was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-, and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg), 4-period, crossover study in 60 healthy volunteers. A marked increase in heart rate (higher than 10 bpm) was measured in subjects receiving intranasal and intravenous esketamine. Summative evidence from both nonclinical and clinical data suggests a lack of clinically relevant QTc prolongation at the normal therapeutic dose of esketamine [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
**Effects on blood pressure**&#13;
&#13;
Eskestamine causes increases in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure at all therapeutic doses. Peak blood pressure elevation after esketamine administration occurs about 40 minutes after administration and lasts approximately 4 hours [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
**Cognitive effects**&#13;
&#13;
In a study of healthy volunteers, one dose of this agent caused decline in cognitive performance 40 minutes after administration.  Compared to subjects ingesting a placebo, esketamine-treated subjects required a higher level of effort to complete assigned cognitive tests at 40 minutes after administration. Cognitive performance and mental effort were found to be similar between esketamine and placebo at 2 hours after administration [FDA label].&#13;
&#13;
Reports of long-term memory or cognitive impairment have been made following repeated ketamine misuse or abuse. No adverse effects of esketamine nasal spray on cognitive function were seen in a one-year open-label safety study. The long-term cognitive effects of esketamine have not been studied for more than a 1 year period, therefore, the risk of cognitive decline with long-term use is not yet confirmed [FDA label]. </pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, is a non-selective, non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. The exact mechanism by which esketamine acts as an antidepressant is unknown. The primary circulating metabolite of esketamine (_noresketamine_) shows activity at the same receptor with a weaker affinity [FDA label]. &#13;
</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>**Ketamine hydrochloride LD50**: 447 mg/kg, Rat (oral) [MSDS]&#13;
&#13;
**Neurotoxicity**&#13;
&#13;
In a one-dose neuronal toxicity study with esketamine intranasal administration to adult female rats, no finding of neuronal vacuolation in the brain occurred with doses up to the equivalent of the maximum recommended human dose of 84 mg/day. In a second single dose neurotoxicity study performed with intranasal esketamine administration in adult female rats, no observation of neuronal necrosis up to a dose equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose was made.  Neuronal vacuolation was not evaluated in this study [FDA label]. The relevance of these findings in humans is unknown at this time [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
**A note on dependence and tolerance**&#13;
&#13;
Reports of physical dependence have been made following prolonged use of ketamine.  Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dosage reduction of a drug is a common manifestation of drug dependence. There were no withdrawal symptoms observed up to 4 weeks in subjects after stopping esketamine treatment. Withdrawal symptoms have been observed after the discontinuation of frequently used (more than weekly) high doses of ketamine for a longer duration. These symptoms of withdrawal have a higher chance of occurring if esketamine was similarly abused [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
Symptoms of withdrawal reported to be associated with daily intake of high ketamine doses include craving, fatigue, poor appetite, and anxiety. Therefore, monitor esketamine-treated patients for symptoms and signs of physical dependence upon the discontinuation of the drug. Tolerance has been reported with prolonged use of ketamine. Tolerance is characterized by a decreased response to a drug following repeated doses (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was previously achieved at a lower dose). Comparable tolerance would be expected to occur with long-term use of esketamine [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
**Use in pregnancy**&#13;
&#13;
This drug may cause fetal harm, based on the findings of animal studies. Pregnancy planning and prevention in females of reproductive potential should occur before the initiation of esketamine treatment [FDA label]. There is a pregnancy registry for women who exposed to esketamine during pregnancy. The goal of the registry is to gather data about the health of women and infants exposed to esketamine.&#13;
&#13;
**Use in lactation**&#13;
&#13;
Esketamine is present in human milk. No safety data on the effects of esketamine on the breastfed infant or on milk production are available. Studies in young animals report neurotoxicity. Due to the risk of neurotoxicity, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with this drug [FDA label]. </toxicity>
  <metabolism>Esketamine is mainly metabolized to the _noresketamine_ metabolite by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Noresketamine is metabolized by cytochrome-dependent metabolic pathways followed by subsequent glucuronidation of metabolites [FDA label]. </metabolism>
  <absorption>Due to the fact that this drug is administered via nasal spray, absorption is rapid. The mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 48% after esketamine nasal spray administration. The time to achieve peak esketamine plasma concentration is 20 to 40 minutes after the last nasal spray of esketamine. Inter-subject variability of esketamine ranges from 27% to 66% for Cmax (maximum concentration) and 18% to 45% for AUC (area under the curve). The intra-subject variability of esketamine is about 15% for Cmax and 10% for AUC [FDA label]. </absorption>
  <half-life>The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) ranges from 7 to 12 hours [FDA label]. </half-life>
  <protein-binding>The protein binding of esketamine is about 43% to 45% [FDA label]. </protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Less than 1% of a dose of nasal esketamine is measured as unchanged drug, excreted in the urine. Following intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) administration, esketamine-derived metabolites were mainly recovered in urine (≥ 78% of a radiolabeled dose), and a smaller percentage was measured in the feces (≤ 2% of a radiolabeled dose) [FDA label]. </route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The average steady-state volume of distribution of esketamine administered by the intravenous route is 709 L [FDA label].</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The average clearance of esketamine is approximately 89 L/hour following intravenous administration [FDA label]. &#13;
&#13;
Elimination of the major esketamine metabolite, _noresketamine_, from plasma is slower than esketamine. The decrease of noresketamine plasma concentrations occurs in a biphasic fashion, with a more rapid decline for the first 4 hours post-administration, and an average terminal t1/2 of approximately 8 hours [FDA label]. </clearance>

        <general-function>Zinc ion binding</general-function>
        <specific-function>NMDA receptor subtype of glutamate-gated ion channels with high calcium permeability and voltage-dependent sensitivity to magnesium. Mediated by glycine. In concert with DAPK1 at extrasynaptic sites, acts as a central mediator for stroke damage. Its phosphorylation at Ser-1303 by DAPK1 enhances synaptic NMDA receptor channel activity inducing injurious Ca2+ influx through them, resulting in an irreversible neuronal death (By similarity).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>NMDA receptor subtype of glutamate-gated ion channels with high calcium permeability and voltage-dependent sensitivity to magnesium. Mediated by glycine. In concert with DAPK1 at extrasynaptic sites, acts as a central mediator for stroke damage. Its phosphorylation at Ser-1303 by DAPK1 enhances synaptic NMDA receptor channel activity inducing injurious Ca2+ influx through them, resulting in an irreversible neuronal death (By similarity).</specific-function>

        <name>Elongation factor 2</name>
        <general-function>Translation elongation factor activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Catalyzes the GTP-dependent ribosomal translocation step during translation elongation. During this step, the ribosome changes from the pre-translocational (PRE) to the post-translocational (POST) state as the newly formed A-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA and P-site-bound deacylated tRNA move to the P and E sites, respectively. Catalyzes the coordinated movement of the two tRNA molecules, the mRNA and conformational changes in the ribosome.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>During development, promotes the survival and differentiation of selected neuronal populations of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Participates in axonal growth, pathfinding and in the modulation of dendritic growth and morphology. Major regulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity at adult synapses in many regions of the CNS. The versatility of BDNF is emphasized by its contribution to a range of adaptive neuronal responses including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), certain forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, as well as homeostatic regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability.</specific-function>

        <name>BDNF/NT-3 growth factors receptor</name>
        <general-function>Protein homodimerization activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the development and the maturation of the central and the peripheral nervous systems through regulation of neuron survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and synapse formation and plasticity. Receptor for BDNF/brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NTF4/neurotrophin-4. Alternatively can also bind NTF3/neurotrophin-3 which is less efficient in activating the receptor but regulates neuron survival through NTRK2. Upon ligand-binding, undergoes homodimerization, autophosphorylation and activation. Recruits, phosphorylates and/or activates several downstream effectors including SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 and PLCG1 that regulate distinct overlapping signaling cascades. Through SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 activates the GRB2-Ras-MAPK cascade that regulates for instance neuronal differentiation including neurite outgrowth. Through the same effectors controls the Ras-PI3 kinase-AKT1 signaling cascade that mainly regulates growth and survival. Through PLCG1 and the downstream protein kinase C-regulated pathways controls synaptic plasticity. Thereby, plays a role in learning and memory by regulating both short term synaptic function and long-term potentiation. PLCG1 also leads to NF-Kappa-B activation and the transcription of genes involved in cell survival. Hence, it is able to suppress anoikis, the apoptosis resulting from loss of cell-matrix interactions. May also play a role in neutrophin-dependent calcium signaling in glial cells and mediate communication between neurons and glia.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. This enzyme contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan.</specific-function>
