  <name>ALGRX 1207</name>
  <description>ALGRX 1207 is a topical local anesthetic that acts by binding to the fast sodium channel. ALGRX 1207 entered clinical trials for cutaneous neuropathic pain, such as chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, in 2006. It was being developed by Anesiva, but trials have halted.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>ALGRX 1207 is a new chemical entity with novel anesthetic properties that provide pain relief by binding to the fast sodium channel on neurons responsible for transmitting pain signals from nerve endings to the brain. Specifically, ALGRX 1207 binds to the fast sodium channel on both A nerve fibers responsible for transmitting immediate "adaptive pain" signals and C nerve fibers responsible for transmitting longer-term, dull, aching throbbing pain signals. By interrupting the communication channel of both A fibers and C fibers, ALGRX 1207 is designed to provide effective topical pain relief with a faster onset and longer duration of action than currently marketed pain products.</mechanism-of-action>
