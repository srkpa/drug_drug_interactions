  <description>Hydromorphone is a pure opioid,[A176468] a semi-synthetic hydrogenated ketone derivative of [morphine] that has been available clinically since 1920. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from [morphine] in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound.[A176471] Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential).[A176495]&#13;
&#13;
The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.[L5795]</description>

  <indication>Hydromorphone is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain and severe chronic pain. Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed.[A176468]&#13;
&#13;
The WHO has proposed a three-step ladder for the management of pain in which it is suggested to start with a non-opioid medication followed by addition of weak opioids to the non-opioid treatment for moderate pain and finishing in the use of strong opioids such as hydromorphone along with the existing regimen for cases of severe pain.[A176471]&#13;
&#13;
Off-label, hydromorphone can be administered for the suppression of refractory cough.[A176468]</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>In clinical trials, hydromorphone has been shown to be suitable for pain relief in patients that do not tolerate the side effects of [morphine] or that suffer from renal failure or asthma. It has been shown to be 5-7 times more potent than morphine with a shorter duration of analgesia.[A176471]&#13;
&#13;
Some of the observed effects of the consumption of hydromorphone for acute pain are complete and longlasting pain relief when compared to other pain relief agents such as [meperidine], [morphine], [diamorphine], [bupivacaine], [indomethacin], and [fentanyl]. On the same trials, hydromorphone was shown to produce respiratory depression, lower cognitive function, miosis, mydriasis, constipation, hypotension, and vertigo but to present a reduced incidence of pruritus (which indicates a lower release of histamine) and nausea.[A176507]&#13;
&#13;
The respiratory depression is known to be caused by the effect on the brain stem respiratory centers as well as to a reduction in the responsiveness of this brain stems to increase carbon dioxide tension.[L5798]</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Hydromorphone is an opioid agonist that can bind to different types of opioid receptors. Its analgesic effect is suggested to be related to the effect on the mu-opioid receptors. It has been reported to also have a minor affinity for the delta and kappa receptor.[A176495, A176504] On the other hand, it is known to act at the level of the medulla which allows it to depress the respiratory drive and suppress cough.[A176468]&#13;
&#13;
The onset of action of the immediate release form of hydromorphone is achieved in 15-20 minutes and having a lasting effect for 3-4 hours while the extended-release form onset of action is of 6 hours lasting for about 13 hours.[A176468]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>The reported LD50 of hydromorphone in the mouse was of 104 mg/kg when given intravenously and 84 mg/kg when given orally.[F4181] The reports of overdose with hydromorphone are characterized by respiratory depression, somnolence, skeletal muscle flaccidity,  cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, myosis, mydriasis, bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and even death.[FDA label]&#13;
&#13;
The management of an overdose might require assisted ventilation, supportive measures, as well as cardiac massage and defibrillation. It can be recommended the use of [naloxone] solely in the cases of respiratory depression. The use of opioid antagonist should be restricted to patients that present respiratory depression as they can produce acute abstinence symptoms.[FDA label]&#13;
&#13;
Hydromorphone was not shown to be mutagenic nor clastogenic and long-term studies of carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. On the other hand, reduced implantation sites and viable fetuses were noted at a 2X normal concentration.[FDA label]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>The metabolism of hydromorphone is mainly hepatic and it is represented by the generation of hydromorphone-3-glucuronide through glucuronidation reactions.[A176468] This primary metabolic pathway is done by the activity of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7.[A176501] The first-pass hepatic metabolism is so large that it represents 62% of the initial administered dose.[A176495]&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, hydromorphone is also characterized by the presence of minor metabolic pathways such as the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-driven generation of norhydromorphone.[A39478]</metabolism>
  <absorption>The immediate release version of hydromorphone reaches its peak concentration after 30-60 minutes while the extended-release version reaches the peak concentration after 9 hours.[A176468] When administered orally, hydromorphone is absorbed mainly in the upper small intestine with a bioavailability of 60% due to intensive first-pass metabolism. In the controlled-release version of hydromorphone, the absorption follows a biphasic pharmacokinetic profile. However, even though there are clear distinctions in the absorption pathway of hydromorphone, the AUC of both versions is reported to be of 34 ng.h/ml which indicates an equivalence.[A176471]&#13;
&#13;
The parenteral administration of hydromorphone, which is the most common pathway, presents an almost immediate absorption as observed by the presence of peak plasma concentration almost immediately. This peak plasma concentration declines rapidly due to fast redistribution into liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle. In the parenteral route, the pharmacokinetic profile is log-linear and dose-dependent and to present a higher bioavailability of 78%.[A176471]&#13;
&#13;
Other administration routes such as rectal, nasal, intraspinal and transdermal present lower bioavailability and changes in their pharmacokinetic profile.[A176471]</absorption>
  <half-life>The half-life of hydromorphone immediate-release is of 2-3 hour while the extended release can range from 8-15 hours.[A176468]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>The protein-bound form of hydromorphone corresponds to about 8-19% of the administered dose.[A176468]</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>The main elimination route of hydromorphone is through the urine in the form of the main metabolite hydromorphone-3-glucuronide. The elimination of the parent compound represents 7% of the urine elimination and 1% of the fecal elimination.[A176468]</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The volume of distribution of hydromorphone is reported to be of 4 L/kg.[A176468]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The mean plasma clearance of hydromorphone is reported to be of 105.7 ml/min.[A176510] The systemic clearance is reported to be of 1.96 L/min.[L5798]</clearance>

        <name>Mu-type opioid receptor</name>
        <general-function>Voltage-gated calcium channel activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl, etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins. The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation. Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects. Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>G-protein coupled receptor that functions as receptor for endogenous enkephalins and for a subset of other opioids. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibits neurotransmitter release by reducing calcium ion currents and increasing potassium ion conductance. Plays a role in the perception of pain and in opiate-mediated analgesia. Plays a role in developing analgesic tolerance to morphine.</specific-function>

        <name>Kappa-type opioid receptor</name>
        <general-function>Opioid receptor activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>G-protein coupled opioid receptor that functions as receptor for endogenous alpha-neoendorphins and dynorphins, but has low affinity for beta-endorphins. Also functions as receptor for various synthetic opioids and for the psychoactive diterpene salvinorin A. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibits neurotransmitter release by reducing calcium ion currents and increasing potassium ion conductance. Plays a role in the perception of pain. Plays a role in mediating reduced physical activity upon treatment with synthetic opioids. Plays a role in the regulation of salivation in response to synthetic opioids. May play a role in arousal and regulation of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. This enzyme contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan.</specific-function>
