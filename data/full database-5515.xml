  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>TG 4001 is based on the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA virus) carrying and expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 genes. The MVA vector is a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus that combines an extensive history of safety with the ability to stimulate a strong immune response to antigens. &#13;
The TG 4001 therapeutic vaccine induces specific immunity by  presentation of E6 and E7 antigens to T cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II inducing specific cellular and humoral responses. A second mechanism may be a non-specific activation of the immune system via the vaccinia virus and the interleukin 2 (IL2) adjuvant of the immune response. TG 4001 could have further applications beyond Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 as a single agent in low grade CIN (CIN1) or cervical cancers in combination with existing treatments.&#13;
