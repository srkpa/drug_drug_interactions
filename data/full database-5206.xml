  <description>PMI-001 is a stand-alone, disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) being developed by Phytomedics Inc. It is an extract of the roots of an undisclosed perennial shrub which interferes with the production of IL-2 and COX-2 proteins, for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus and psoriasis.</description>

  <indication>Investigated for use/treatment in rheumatoid arthritis.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>PMI-001 is a novel, orally bioavailable, small-molecule-based, plant-derived, multi-component disease modifying agent currently being developed for rheumatoid arthritis. Potential applications of this drug candidate beyond rheumatoid arthritis include a wide range of autoimmune disorders including psoriasis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and multiple sclerosis (MS).</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>PMI-001 exerts its potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant activities through unique and synergistic modes of action, which involves potent inhibition of several families of pro-inflammatory genes. PMI-001 most likely interferes with the production of IL-2 and COX-2 proteins.</mechanism-of-action>
