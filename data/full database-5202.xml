  <indication>Investigated for use/treatment in insomnia.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>In two Phase I/II studies using the traffic noise model of insomnia in healthy male volunteers, EVT 201 significantly reduced "wake after sleep onset" (WASO) while significantly increasing "total sleep time" (TST) and quality of sleep with no subjective residual effects. The compound was well tolerated without significant adverse events.</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>EVT 201 is a partial positive allosteric modulator (pPAM) of the GABAA receptor complex and consequently works through a proven pathway in the treatment of insomnia. However, EVT 201â€™s partial agonist activity gives it a differentiated pre-clinical profile and mechanism of action compared to many currently marketed sleep-promoting agents.</mechanism-of-action>
