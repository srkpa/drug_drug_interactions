  <description>DG041 is a novel, first-in-class, orally-administered small molecule developmented for the prevention of arterial thrombosis and its complications. &#13;
DG041, an anti-platelet compound, has shown to be a selective and potent antagonist of the EP3 receptor for prostaglandins E2. EP3 is a target that associates with increased risk of various vascular diseases. It block the formation of blood clots mediated through inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques but without increasing bleeding risk.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>DG041 is an antagonist of the EP3 receptor for prostaglandins E2 - a receptor involved in peripheral artery disease (PAD). DG041 produces concentration-dependent inhibition of one of the platelet activation pathways and reduces platelet aggregation without increasing bleeding time.&#13;
Studies have shown that DG041 dramatically inhibits platelet activation mediated through VASP as well as platelet aggregation. DG041 also reduced levels of another indicator of platelet activation, p-selectin, and several markers of inflammation -- c-reactive protein (CRP), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule (sICAM) -- in a dose-dependent manner.</mechanism-of-action>
