  <description>Vayarin is a prescription medical food for the clinical dietary management of certain lipid imbalances blamed to be associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Vayarin contains _Lipirinen_, a proprietary composition containing phosphatidylserine-omega 3, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [L1500, L14501, L1510]. Vayarin is currently available only by prescription in the USA [L1502].  This drug has also been used for management of hypertriglyceridemia [L1503].&#13;
&#13;
Vayarin is an orally administered prescription medical food for the clinical dietary management of complex lipid imbalances thought to be associated with ADHD. Vayarin is a specially formulated and designed to address the distinct, previously determined lipid nutritional requirements of children with ADHD, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved with lifestyle modification [L1502].&#13;
&#13;
Vayarin is a novel therapy for ADHD that appears to be effective in several studies [L1501, L1502, L1503]. Approximately 60% of the users who completed 12 weeks of therapy reported subjective benefits from treatment. A slow response time of 12 weeks is an impediment to successful management of ADHD as only 41.6% of subjects prescribed Vayarin remained compliant for the duration of the study. Cost of the drug and patient aversion to the taste of Vayarin were significant reasons for therapy failure [L1502].</description>

  <indication>ADHD in children,  hypertriglyceridemia [L1502, L1503].</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Compared to healthy children of the same age, children with ADHD have lower circulating concentrations of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid. These lipids, found in the brain, play an essential role in central nervous system development and function. It has been reported that omega-3 fatty acid deficiency is directly associated with decreased brain phosphatidylserine, which is mainly in the form of phosphatidylserine-Omega-3 (Ps-Omega-3) [L1500, L1502].&#13;
&#13;
PS-Omega-3 such as Vayarin, are believed to be essential in the functioning of neuronal cell membranes, in activities such as signal transduction, secretory vesicle release, cell-to-cell communication, and cell growth regulation. Reduced levels of PS-Omega-3 and omega-3 fatty acids may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ADHD and other neuronal disorders. Vayarin is a proprietary lipid composition of phosphatidylserine-Omega-3 (PS-Omega-3), enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid. This formula has been designed to provide the essential lipids to brain tissues in order to support and maintain proper brain function. Additionally, the enrichment of EPA in the Vayarin medical food allows for better regulation of lipids and acts on the specific imbalances that are thought to be associated with ADHD [A32047, L1500].&#13;
&#13;
Current studies are underway for the efficacy of Vayarin in ADHD and autism spectrum disorder co-morbidity [L1500].  In addition, studies of Vayarin in adults using MRI to study alterations in radiographic findings are currently underway, allowing for other possible benefits of this medication [L1501].&#13;
&#13;
</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Phosphatidylserine (PS) in the mammalian nervous system, containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, has been implicated in numerous membrane-associated functions, such as maintaining the integrity of cell membranes, cell excitability and cell-to-cell recognition and communication. While the exact mechanism by which this medical food exerts its effects is not fully understood, PS has been found to regulate important proteins in neuronal cell membranes, including sodium/calcium ATPase and protein kinase C, which perform crucial functions in many signal transduction pathways. Similarly, PS interacts with Raf-1 protein kinase [L1506] to promote a cascade of reactions that are believed to be involved in the survival of cells [L1506]. Additionally, PS has been found to influence neurotransmitter activity, such as the release of acetylcholine (Ach), dopamine, and noradrenaline. In addition, it is also thought to increase brain glucose concentrations [L1506]. Administration of specially processed formulations consisting of PS conjugated to omega-3 fatty acids was found to significantly increase DHA levels in the brain tissue of rats [L1506].  </mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>The safety phosphatidyl serine conjugated to omega-3 (PS-Omega-3) is supported by several pre-clinical studies. Multiple dose safety studies in rats and dogs showed that oral administration of PS-Omega-3 at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day for up to 6 months was without any significant effects. Teratogenicity studies in rats demonstrate that when given at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses up to 450 mg/kg/ day, Ps Omega-3 (the main component of this medical food) did not affect embryonic and fetal development. The mutagenic potential of PS-Omega-3 was investigated in several cell types and revealed no significant findings. In a micronucleus test, PS-Omega-3 was given to mice at total dosages of 30, 150 and 300 mg/kg in two equal doses separated by 24 hours. The results of the study did not demonstrate any evidence of mutagenic properties or incidence of bone marrow toxicity [L1506].&#13;
&#13;
In rats, Ld50 was greater than 5 mg/Kg for PS [L1506, L1508].</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Phospholipids can break down into various substrates or remain intact and absorbed in the circulatory system and cross the blood brain barrier. Following dietary ingestion of PS, fatty acids esterified to the PS molecule are hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, forming lyso-PS and free fatty acids (FFA). After the lyso-PS is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, it can be re-acylated into PS, while partially converted into other phospholipids. Phosphatidylserine and other phospholipids formed inside the enterocytes can either be transported in the lymphatic circulation as chylomicrons or in the hepatic circulation, and enter the systemic circulation for distribution across the body. Current evidence shows that ingested phosphatidylserine reaches the systemic circulation and is incorporated into the phospholipids pool as phosphatidylethanolamine and other metabolites [L1506, L1510].&#13;
&#13;
The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism cycle begins with a series of desaturation, elongation and  β-oxidation reactions.  In a study of healthy volunteers and patients with hypertriglyceridemia, eicosapentaenoic acid, and DHA were absorbed when administered as ethyl esters orally. Omega-3-acids administered as ethyl esters (Vayarin) induced significant, dose-dependent increases in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic acid content, though increases in DHA content were less significant and not dose-dependent when administered as ethyl esters. Uptake of EPA and DHA into serum phospholipids in subjects treated with Vayarin was independent of age (&lt;49 years versus ≥49 years). Females were found to have more uptake of EPA into serum phospholipids than males [L1503].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The effect of a mixture of free fatty acids (FFA), EPA/DHA and their FFA-albumin conjugate on cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase activities was assessed in human liver microsomes. At the 23 μM concentration, FFA resulted in a less than 32% inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A. At the 23 μM concentration, the FFA-albumin conjugate resulted in a less than 20% inhibition of CYP2A6, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A, with a 68% inhibition being seen for CYP2E1 [L1503].&#13;
&#13;
In healthy volunteers and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), EPA and DHA were absorbed when administered as ethyl esters orally. Omega-3-acids administered as ethyl esters (Vayarin) induced significant, dose–dependent increases in serum phospholipid EPA content, though increases in DHA content were less marked and not dose-dependent when administered as ethyl esters. Uptake of EPA and DHA into serum phospholipids in subjects treated with Vayarin was independent of age (&lt;49 years vs. ≥49 years). Females tended to have more uptake of EPA into serum phospholipids than males. Pharmacokinetic data on Vayarin in children are not available [L1506, L1508].</metabolism>
  <absorption>Phosphatidylserine (the main component of this medical food) is an endogenous substance found in the human body.  This medication is metabolized mainly in the intestines by decarboxylases in the mucosal cells [L1506]. The bioavailability of the ingested PS is poorly demonstrated to extensive metabolism in the intestine before absorption, and due to the fact that PS is transported and rapidly converted into other endogenous constituents [L1507].&#13;
&#13;
In one study, after oral administration of Vayarin to rats, most of the isotope label recovered from blood samples remained as the parent compound, PS,  for up to 60 min after administration. After 24 h, metabolites were recovered from the blood, primarily as lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine. When radiolabeled PS was administered (orally or intraperitoneally) in animals, the radioactivity found in the urine was primarily metabolized (water soluble), whereas the 60-65% of fecal radioactivity was mainly associated with lipids. The major metabolite recovered in the feces was lysoPS after oral administration [L1507].</absorption>

        <specific-function>Isoform 2 does not exhibit any catalytic activity toward 20:3n-6, but it may enhance FADS2 activity (By similarity). Isoform 1 is a component of a lipid metabolic pathway that catalyzes biosynthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) from precursor essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) linoleic acid (LA) (18:2n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3n-3). Catalyzes the desaturation of dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid (DHGLA) (20:3n-6) and eicosatetraenoic acid (20:4n-3) to generate arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)(20:5n-3), respectively.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle. Condensing enzyme that specifically elongates C24:0 and C26:0 acyl-CoAs. May participate to the production of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators. May play a critical role in early brain and skin development.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Catalyzes the desaturation of acyl-CoAs to 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs. Isoform 1 shows highest activity against medium-chain fatty acyl-CoAs and activity decreases with increasing chain length. Isoform 2 is active against a much broader range of substrates and shows activity towards very long-chain acyl-CoAs. Isoform 2 is twice as active as isoform 1 against 16-hydroxy-palmitoyl-CoA and is 25% more active against 1,16-hexadecanodioyl-CoA.</specific-function>
