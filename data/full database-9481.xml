  <name>Moxidectin</name>
  <description>Moxidectin is a potent, broad-spectrum endectocide (antiparasitic that is active against endo- and ecto-parasites) with activity against nematodes, insects, and acari. It was first used in cattle followed by an approved use in general animals. It is a semi-synthetic methoxine derivative of nemadectin which is a 16-member pentacyclic lactone of the milbemycin class. Moxidectin differs by the absence of a disaccharide moiety on carbon 13, a substituted olefinic side chain at carbon 25 and a unique methoxime moiety at carbon 23. Due to these modifications, moxidectin is classified as a second generation macrocyclic lactone.[A33385] Moxidectin was developed by Medicines Development for Global Health and FDA approved in June 13, 2018.[L2970]</description>

  <indication>Moxidectin is indicated for the treatment of river blindness, also called onchocerciasis, in patients aged 12 years and older. River blindness is caused by a parasitic worm _Onchocerca volvulus_ and it is manifested as severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions and visual impairment caused by the worm's larvae.[L2971] &#13;
&#13;
The transmission of _Onchocerca volvulus_ is performed person to person by black flies that breed in fast-flowing rivers in sub-Saharan Africa, Yemen and South and Central America. The larvae released by the adult parasite invade skin and eyes where they can produce the severe disease manifestations.[L2971]</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Moxidectin has been reported to be highly effective against _Onchocerca volvulus_ when compared to ivermectin.[A33398] When moxidectin was administered in infected individuals, the microfilarial load in the skin was lower even when compared to the current therapy, ivermectin. The levels of microfilarial got reduced to an undetectable level while being safe to be used in mass drug administration.[L2986]</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Moxidectin selectively binds to the parasite's GABA-A and glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which are vital for the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. It presents activity against the parasite but it does not kill him.[L2971] Once moxidectin is bound, there is an increased permeability leading to an influx of chloride ions and flaccid paralysis of the parasite.[A33385]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>Moxidectin is reported to be safe as it is reported to be a poor substrate of P-glycoprotein.[A33385] The reported LD50in mice are in the range of 70-131 micromol/kg.[A33397] Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. Moxidectin was shown to present no effects in genotoxicity, mutagenicity and fertility.[FDA label] The reports of overdose there are related to the presence of transient and self-limiting neurological signs including the presence of convulsions.[F139]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Reports have registered enzymatic modification in humans and in nematodes. In the case of moxidectin, there has been registered C29-30- and C14-mono-hydroxymethyl derivatives mainly by the cytochrome CYP3A and CYP2B. The metabolism of moxidectin is considered to contribute to a small extent to the elimination.[A33398] Some other metabolites formed are O-demethyl-dihydroxy metabolites. The metabolism of the of moxidectin is not major as the major residue in fat, liver, kidney and muscle is the unchanged moxidectin.[T236]</metabolism>
  <absorption>The penetration of moxidectin in the parasite is not restricted as this compound is a very poor substrate of p-glycoprotein, which is vital for the reduction of the uptake of lipophilic compounds from the GI tract and for the increase in biliary, intestinal and renal secretion. After oral administration of moxidectin, the plasma maximal concentration of 70.4 mg/kg was reached after 0.37 day with a reported AUC of 363.6 mcg/day/ml.[A33385] It is also important to mention that oral bioavailability is enhanced with the co-administration with lipids.[T237]</absorption>
  <half-life>Moxidectin reporter terminal half-life is 20.2 days.[A33398]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>This pharmacokinetic property in humans is unknown.[FDA label]</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>When moxidectin is orally administered, 2% of the dose is eliminated unchanged in the feces within 72 hours. Renal elimination is negligible.[FDA label]</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>Moxidectin presents a larger volume of distribution and mean residence time when compared to ivermectin. The reported volume of distribution is of 1.2 l/kg.[A33398]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The apparent clearance of moxidectin is 3.5 L/hour.[A33428]</clearance>
  <classification>
    <description>This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as milbemycins. These are a group of macrolides with a structure containing a 16-membered lactone ring fused to a 1,7-dioxaspiroundecane ring system and to either a benzofuran (or hydrogenated derivative thereof). In some cases (e.g. Milbemycin E), the tetrahydrofuranyl ring is missing. Milbemycins can be o-glycosylated at C13 to form Avermectins. Milbemycins are produced by Streptomyces species.</description>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>High-capacity urate exporter functioning in both renal and extrarenal urate excretion. Plays a role in porphyrin homeostasis as it is able to mediates the export of protoporhyrin IX (PPIX) both from mitochondria to cytosol and from cytosol to extracellular space, and cellular export of hemin, and heme. Xenobiotic transporter that may play an important role in the exclusion of xenobiotics from the brain. Appears to play a major role in the multidrug resistance phenotype of several cancer cell lines. Implicated in the efflux of numerous drugs and xenobiotics: mitoxantrone, the photosensitizer pheophorbide, camptothecin, methotrexate, azidothymidine (AZT), and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin.</specific-function>
