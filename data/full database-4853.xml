  <name>PTC299</name>
  <description>PTC299 is a novel, orally administered small-molecule designed to inhibit the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumors. Overexpression of VEGF plays a key role in multiple diseases including cancer and macular degeneration. PTC299 was discovered through PTC's GEMS technology by targeting the post-transcriptional processes that regulate VEGF formation, and is currently being developed for the treatment of cancer. </description>

  <indication>Investigated for use/treatment in cancer/tumors (unspecified) and solid tumors.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>PTC299 demonstrated a broad range of activity in blocking VEGF synthesis in multiple tumor types, including breast, cervical, colorectal, fibrosarcoma, gastric, lung, melanoma, neuroblastoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate and renal cell cancer lines. PTC299 as a monotherapy significantly reduced VEGF concentrations in tumors and plasma, reduced tumor blood vessel density, and substantially impeded tumor progression.</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>PTC299 was designed to inhibit VEGF production in tumors by targeting the post-transcriptional control processes that regulate VEGF formation. Because PTC299 inhibits VEGF production, its action occurs at a different point in the VEGF pathway than therapies, such as Avastin® or Sutent®. PTC299 may be active both as a single agent or when used in combination with other anti-angiogenic agents or with chemotherapy agents for the treatment of cancers.</mechanism-of-action>
