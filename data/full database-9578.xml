  <indication>&#13;
Thiocolchicoside is a  skeletal muscle-relaxant drug used in the treatment of orthopedic, traumatic and rheumatologic disorders [L1661]. It is indicated as an adjuvant drug in the treatment of painful muscle contractures and is indicated in acute spinal pathology, for adults and adolescents 16 years of age and older [L1658]. Recent studies have examined its effect on muscle tone, stiffness, contractures, and soreness experienced by athletes during sporting competitions [L1664].</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Thiocholchicoside is a muscle relaxing agent that works through selective binding to the GABA-A receptor. It prevents muscle contractions by activating the GABA inhibitory motor pathway [L1661].&#13;
&#13;
This medication acts as a competitive GABA receptor antagonist and inhibits glycine receptors with similar potency as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It has powerful convulsant activity and should not be used in individuals at risk for seizures [L1661, L1669].&#13;
&#13;
Used in combination with glafenine and meprobamate to tranquilize patients undergoing hysterosalpingography. In the treatment of painful muscle spasms. Thiocolchicoside acts both in contractures with a central cause and in contractures of reflex type, rheumatic and traumatic. It also alleviates symptoms of spastic sequelae of hemiparesis, Parkinson's disease and iatrogenic Parkinson symptoms, particularly neurodyslectic syndrome.  Some other conditions that may benefit from this medication are acute and chronic lumbar and sciatic pain, cervico-brachial neuralgia, persistent torticollis, post-traumatic and post-operative pain [L1661].</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Thiocolchicoside, is a synthetic sulfur derivative of colchicoside, a naturally occurring glucoside contained in the Colchicum autumnale plant. Thiocolchicoside has a selective and potent afﬁnity for g-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptors and acts on muscular contractures by activating the GABA inhibitory pathways thereby behaving as a potent muscle relaxant [L1661].  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human cortex [A18424].  GABAergic neurons are involved in myorelaxation, anxiolytic treatment, sedation, and anesthetics. GABA can also modulate heart rate and blood pressure.&#13;
&#13;
It also has an affinity for the inhibitory glycine receptors (i.e., have glycomimetic and GABA mimetic activity), therefore acts as a muscle relaxant. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and acts as an allosteric regulator of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. It is involved in the processing of motor and sensory data, thereby regulating movement, vision, and audition. Inhibitory neurotransmitter in spinal cord, allosteric regulator of NMDA receptors [L1663, A32122].&#13;
&#13;
In one study, thiocolchicoside inhibited the function of recombinant human strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors composed of the alpha1 subunit with a potency (median inhibitory concentration of 47 microM) lower than that apparent with recombinant GABA(A) receptors. The drug also inhibited the function of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors made of the alpha4 and beta2 subunits, however, this effect was partial and moreover only apparent at high concentrations. Thiocolchicoside demonstrated no effect on the function of 5-HT(3A) serotonin receptors [A18424].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>Has been shown to cause chromosomal aneuploidy and male infertility. Should be avoided during all stages of pregnancy, lactation and puberty.  Is a potential risk factor for cancer. &#13;
&#13;
In 2013, The European Medical Association (EMA) mandated that the use of thiocolchicoside-containing medicines by mouth or injection should be restricted across the European Union (EU). These drugs are now recommended only as an add-on treatment for painful muscle contractures resulting from spinal conditions in adults and adolescents 16 years old and older.  Additionally, the dose of thiocolchicoside by mouth or injection should be limited.  This is due to experimental evidence suggesting that thiocolchicoside was metabolized into M2 or SL59.0955,  that has the propensity to damage dividing cells, resulting in aneuploidy (an abnormal number or arrangement of chromosomes). As a result, the CHMP (committee for medicinal products for human use) examined the safety profile of this medicine and consider what regulatory action might be appropriate [L1656].&#13;
&#13;
The CHMP reviewed the evidence, with consideration of opinions from experts in medicines safety, and concluded that aneuploidy may occur with M2 at levels not significantly greater than those measured after recommended doses of thiocolchicoside ingested orally. Aneuploidy is a strong risk factor for fetal harm, decreased fertility in men, and could theoretically increase the risk of developing cancer [L1656].&#13;
&#13;
The maximum recommended oral dose is 8 mg every 12 hours; treatment length should not exceed 7 consecutive days. When given intramuscularly (IM), the maximum dose is 4 mg every 12 hours, for a maximum of 5 days [L1656].&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the above toxicity, a study was done on the hepatotoxic potential of thiocolchicoside.  It was observed that serum AST and ALT levels increased following of the administration oral thiocolchicoside at 8 mg/day. Two weeks after discontinuing thiocolchicoside therapy, liver enzymes had decreased to levels within the normal range. Although infrequent, thiocolchicoside should be considered a rare hepatotoxic agent in clinical practice [A32121].</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Thiocolchicoside is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and metabolized into 3 main metabolites [L1661].&#13;
&#13;
Firstly, in the intestines to 3-demethylcolchicine (inactive metabolite). This product is further metabolized in circulation by either conjugation to 3-O-glucurono-demethylcolchicine (active metabolite) or demethylated to didemethylcolchicine (inactive metabolite)</metabolism>
  <absorption>Oral bioavailability is ~25%&#13;
After intramuscular administration, thiocolchicoside Cmax occur in 30 min and .reach values of 113 ng/mL after a 4 mg dose and 175 ng/mL after a 8 mg dose. The corresponding values of AUC are respectively 283 and 417 ng.h/mL. The pharmacologically active metabolite SL18.0740 is found at lower concentrations with a Cmax of 11.7 ng/mL occurring 5 h post administration and an AUC of 83 ng.h/mL [L1658].&#13;
&#13;
After oral administration, no thiocolchicoside is detected in plasma. Only two metabolites are observed: The pharmacologically active metabolite SL18.0740 and an inactive metabolite SL59.0955. For both metabolites, maximum plasma concentrations occur 1hour after thiocolchicoside administration. After a single oral dose of 8 mg of thiocolchicoside the Cmax and AUC of SL18.0740 are about 60 ng/mL and 130 ng.h/mL respectively. For SL59.0955 these values are much lower: Cmax around 13 ng/mL and AUC ranging from 15.5 ng.h/mL (until 3h) to 39.7 ng.h/mL (until 24h) [L1658].&#13;
&#13;
</absorption>
  <half-life>Approximately 7.7h [L1670].</half-life>
  <protein-binding>&#13;
The binding of 3H-colchicine and its derivative 3H-thiocolchicoside to human serum, purified human proteins, as well as red blood cells was studied using equilibrium dialysis and centrifugation. Binding of colchicine and thiocolchicoside to human serum was 38.9 C +/- 4.7 and 12.8 C +/- 5.3%, respectively, to albumin [A18437]. </protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Thiocolchicoside is not eliminated unchanged,  rather as one of three metabolites found in either feces (~79 %) or in urine 20%. 3- demethylcolchicine (M2) and 3-O-glucurono-demethylcolchicine (M1) are found in both urine and feces, where as di-demethylcolchicine is found only in feces [L1670].</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The apparent volume of distribution of thiocolchicoside is estimated to be approximately 42.7 L after an intramuscular injection of 8 mg [L1658].</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>&#13;
Primarily extrarenal elimination (75% of the total body clearance) [A32123].</clearance>

        <general-function>Gaba-a receptor activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain, mediates neuronal inhibition by binding to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor and opening an integral chloride channel. In the uterus, the function of the receptor appears to be related to tissue contractility. The binding of this pI subunit with other GABA(A) receptor subunits alters the sensitivity of recombinant receptors to modulatory agents such as pregnanolone.</specific-function>

Augments the ability of dendritic cells to stimulate naive T-cell proliferation. May be an important regulator of interactions between T-cells and dendritic cells and may play a role in the regulation of the T-cell-dependent immune response. May also play an important role in enhanced bone-resorption in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.</specific-function>
