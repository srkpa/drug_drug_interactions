  <description>Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs). PGs contribute to inflammation and pain signalling. Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, is often used as first line therapy for acute and chronic pain and inflammation from a variety of causes. Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of [phenylbutazone], [mefenamic acid], and [indomethacin].[A180796] The addition of two chlorine groups in the ortho position of the phenyl ring locks the ring in maximal torsion which appears to be related to increased potency. It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy).[L7360]</description>

  <indication>Diclofenac is indicated for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation from varying sources including inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and akylosing spondylitis, as well as injury-related inflammation due to surgery and physical trauma. It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Diclofenac reduces inflammation and by extension reduces nociceptive pain and combats fever.[label,T116] It also increases the risk of developing a gastrointestinal ulcer by inhibiting the production of protective mucus in the stomach.</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.&#13;
&#13;
PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activates the G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled EP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also activates the EP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, coupled to G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; act via EP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor which couples to G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is known to play a role via its G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.&#13;
&#13;
PGI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.[A179044] PGI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and EP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.&#13;
&#13;
PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; EP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.&#13;
</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>Symptoms of overdose include lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding.[label] Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma occur rarely. In case of overdose, provide supportive care and consider inducing emesis and administering activated charcoal if overdose occurred less than 4 hours prior.</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Diclofenac undergoes oxidative metabolism to hydroxy metabolites as well as conjugation to glucuronic acid, sulfate, and taurine.[label,A178633] The primary metabolite is 4'-hydroxy diclofenac which is generated by CYP2C9. This metabolite is very weakly active with one thirtieth the activity of diclofenac. Other metabolites include 3'-hydroxy diclofenac, 3'-hydroxy-4'methoxy diclofenac, 4',5-dihydroxy diclofenac, an acylglucuronide conjugate, and other conjugate metabolites.</metabolism>
  <absorption>Diclofenac is completely absorbed from the GI tract but likely undergoes significant first pass metabolism with only 60% of the drug reaching systemic circulation unchanged [label,A178633,A180694]. Many topical formulations are absorbed percutaneous and produce clinically significant plasma concentrations. Absorption is dose proportional over the range of 25-150 mg.[A178633] Tmax varies between formulations with the oral solution reaching peak plasma concentrations in 10-40min, the enteric coated tablet in 1.5-2h, and the sustained- and extended-release formulations prolonging Tmax even further. Administration with food has no significant effects on AUC but does delay Tmax to 2.5-12h.[A178633,A180694] </absorption>
  <half-life>The terminal half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 h, however the apparent half-life including all metabolites is 25.8-33 h.[label,A180694]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>Diclofenac is over 99.7% bound to serum proteins, primarily albumin.[A178633] It is undergoes limited binding to lipoproteins as well with 1.1% bound to HDL, 0.3% to LDL, and 0.15% to VLDL.</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Diclofenac is mainly eliminated via metabolism.[A178633,A180694] Of the total dose, 60-70% is eliminated in the urine and 30% is eliminated in the feces. No significant enterohepatic recycling occurs.</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>Diclofenac has a total volume of distribution of 5-10 L or 0.1-0.2 L/kg.[A178633] The volume of the central compartment is 0.04 L/kg.[A180694] Diclofenac distributes to the synovial fluid reaching peak concentration 2-4h after administration.[A178633] There is limited crossing of the blood brain barrier and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations only reach 8.22% of plasma concentrations. Doses of 50 mg delivered via intramuscular injection produced no detectable diclofenac concentrations in breast milk, however metabolite concentrations were not investigated. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placenta in mice and rats but human data is unavailable.[A180694]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>Diclofenac has a plasma clearance 16 L/h.[A180694]</clearance>

        <specific-function>Converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Constitutively expressed in some tissues in physiological conditions, such as the endothelium, kidney and brain, and in pathological conditions, such as in cancer. PTGS2 is responsible for production of inflammatory prostaglandins. Up-regulation of PTGS2 is also associated with increased cell adhesion, phenotypic changes, resistance to apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis. In cancer cells, PTGS2 is a key step in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays important roles in modulating motility, proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.</specific-function>

        <general-function>Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection. In platelets, it is involved in the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which promotes platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. This enzyme contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Most active in catalyzing 2-hydroxylation. Caffeine is metabolized primarily by cytochrome CYP1A2 in the liver through an initial N3-demethylation. Also acts in the metabolism of aflatoxin B1 and acetaminophen. Participates in the bioactivation of carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Catalizes the N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines and the O-deethylation of phenacetin.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. In the epoxidation of arachidonic acid it generates only 14,15- and 11,12-cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>UDPGTs are of major importance in the conjugation and subsequent elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. This isozyme is active on polyhydroxylated estrogens (such as estriol, 4-hydroxyestrone and 2-hydroxyestriol) and xenobiotics (such as 4-methylumbelliferone, 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-aminophenol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl and menthol). It is capable of 6 alpha-hydroxyglucuronidation of hyodeoxycholic acid.</specific-function>

        <general-function>Sodium-independent organic anion transmembrane transporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Involved in the renal elimination of endogenous and exogenous organic anions. Functions as organic anion exchanger when the uptake of one molecule of organic anion is coupled with an efflux of one molecule of endogenous dicarboxylic acid (glutarate, ketoglutarate, etc). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) (By similarity). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of p-aminohippurate (PAH), ochratoxin (OTA), acyclovir (ACV), 3'-azido-3-'deoxythymidine (AZT), cimetidine (CMD), 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetate (2,4-D), hippurate (HA), indoleacetate (IA), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate (CMPF), cidofovir, adefovir, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine (PMEG), 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) diaminopurine (PMEDAP) and edaravone sulfate. PAH uptake is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulphonate (PCMBS), diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), sulindac, diclofenac, carprofen, glutarate and okadaic acid (By similarity). PAH uptake is inhibited by benzothiazolylcysteine (BTC), S-chlorotrifluoroethylcysteine (CTFC), cysteine S-conjugates S-dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC), furosemide, steviol, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore A23187, benzylpenicillin, furosemide, indomethacin, bumetamide, losartan, probenecid, phenol red, urate, and alpha-ketoglutarate.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Mediates the Na(+)-independent high affinity transport of organic anions such as the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and rT3. Other potential substrates, such as triiodothyronine (T3), 17-beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, estrone-3-sulfate and sulfobromophthalein (BSP) are transported with much lower efficiency. May play a signifiant role in regulating T4 flux into and out of the brain (By similarity).</specific-function>

        <name>Sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha</name>
        <general-function>Voltage-gated sodium channel activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>This protein mediates the voltage-dependent sodium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Assuming opened or closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane, the protein forms a sodium-selective channel through which Na(+) ions may pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. This sodium channel may be present in both denervated and innervated skeletal muscle.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Isoform 2 and isoform 3 function as proton-gated sodium channels; they are activated by a drop of the extracellular pH and then become rapidly desensitized. The channel generates a biphasic current with a fast inactivating and a slow sustained phase. Has high selectivity for sodium ions and can also transport lithium ions with high efficiency. Isoform 2 can also transport potassium, but with lower efficiency. It is nearly impermeable to the larger rubidium and cesium ions. Isoform 3 can also transport calcium ions. Mediates glutamate-independent Ca(2+) entry into neurons upon acidosis. This Ca(2+) overloading is toxic for cortical neurons and may be in part responsible for ischemic brain injury. Heteromeric channel assembly seems to modulate channel properties. Functions as a postsynaptic proton receptor that influences intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation and thereby the density of dendritic spines. Modulates activity in the circuits underlying innate fear.Isoform 1 does not display proton-gated cation channel activity.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Probably important in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Associates with KCNQ3 to form a potassium channel with essentially identical properties to the channel underlying the native M-current, a slowly activating and deactivating potassium conductance which plays a critical role in determining the subthreshold electrical excitability of neurons as well as the responsiveness to synaptic inputs. KCNQ2/KCNQ3 current is blocked by linopirdine and XE991, and activated by the anticonvulsant retigabine. Muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M strongly suppress KCNQ2/KCNQ3 current in cells in which cloned KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels were coexpressed with M1 muscarinic receptors.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Probably important in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Associates with KCNQ2 or KCNQ5 to form a potassium channel with essentially identical properties to the channel underlying the native M-current, a slowly activating and deactivating potassium conductance which plays a critical role in determining the subthreshold electrical excitability of neurons as well as the responsiveness to synaptic inputs.</specific-function>
