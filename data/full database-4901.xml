  <indication>For the treatment of atherosclerosis and other conditions related to the obstruction of blood vessels.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Oral administration of AC3056 results in dose-dependent antioxidant activity and was well tolerated. In 2002, positive results were reported from a phase I trial. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 14 healthy subjects received an oral formulation of AC3056 in a dose-escalating manner. Results demonstrated dose-dependent increases in blood levels of AC3056, as well as dose-dependent increases in serum antioxidant activity. The drug was well tolerated with no safety concerns.</pharmacodynamics>
