  <description>Persistent forms of tuberculosis (TB) have proven to be a major cause of global morbidity and mortality and a cause for significant concern. Research in recent years has been geared toward the development of novel therapies that target persistent forms of this disease, which have shown resistance to standard therapy regimens.[A182915] Pretomanid is an antimycobacterial agent that is administered with [Bedaquiline] and [Linezolid] to treat resistant forms of pulmonary TB. It was the first TB drug developed by a nonprofit organization, known as TB Alliance, and was granted FDA approval on August 14, 2019.[L8048,L8066] Unlike other therapeutic regimens for the treatment of resistant TB, which may take 18 months or longer and may not be effective, the pretomanid-containing regimen allows for a more efficacious and shorter duration of treatment with fewer drugs.[L8066]</description>

  <indication>Pretomanid is indicated for adults in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid for the treatment of pulmonary forms of nonresponsive multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and treatment-intolerant forms of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).[L8048]&#13;
&#13;
It is important to note that the following conditions are not approved indications for pretomanid therapy, according to the FDA[L8048]:&#13;
&#13;
Drug-sensitive (DS) tuberculosis, latent tuberculosis caused by M.tuberculosis, extra-pulmonary tuberculosis caused by M.tuberculosis, and &#13;
multidrug-resistant TB that is not treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive to conventional TB therapy.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Pretomanid kills the actively replicating bacteria causing tuberculosis, known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and shortens the duration of treatment in patients who suffer from resistant forms of pulmonary TB by killing dormant bacteria.[A182897,A182903,A182972,L8048]&#13;
&#13;
In rodent models of tuberculosis infection, pretomanid administered in a regimen with bedaquiline and linezolid caused a significant reduction in pulmonary bacterial cell counts. A decrease in the frequency of TB relapses at 2 and 3 months after treatment was observed after the administration of this regimen, when compared to the administration of a 2-drug regimen.[L8048] Successful outcomes have been recorded for patients with XDR and MDR following a clinical trial of the pretomanid regimen, demonstrating a 90% cure rate after 6 months.[L8069]&#13;
&#13;
**A note on cardiac QT prolongation, hepatotoxicity, and myelosuppression**&#13;
&#13;
This drug has the propensity to caused cardiac QT interval prolongation and significant hepatotoxicity, as well as myelosuppression. Caution must be observed during the administration of this drug.[L8048,L8057]</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Pretomanid is a prodrug which is metabolically activated by a nitroreductase enzyme, known as Ddn, producing various active metabolites that are responsible for its other therapeutic actions, particularly the induction of nitric oxide. The nitroreductase enzyme which activates pretomanid is deazaflavin dependent and relies on reduced cofactor F420. Reduction of F420 occurs via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.[L8048] Reduction of pretomanid's imidazole ring at the C-3 position causes the formation of the metabolites, which include a des-nitro derivative. The formation of this derivative leads to increased levels of nitric oxide, leading to bactericidal activities under anaerobic conditions via its action as a bacterial respiratory poison.[A182894,L8048] Bactericidal activity against anaerobes is reported to be associated with a shortened duration of antibiotic treatment.[A182897] &#13;
&#13;
Pretomanid exerts aerobic bactericidal effects through its inhibitory actions on bacterial cell wall mycolic acid biosynthesis. This allows for the killing of actively replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, resulting in the treatment of active tuberculosis infection.[A182897,L8048] The molecular mechanism of the above bactericidal effects is poorly understood at this time, but may involve effects exerted on various genes that affect the cell wall, including the fasI and fasII as well as the efpA and iniBAC operons. Other possible targets include the genes of the cyd operon. The clinical effects of the above target relations are unknown at this time.[A182903] </mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>To this date, there is no documented experience with the treatment of a pretomanid overdose. The FDA label advises that general supportive measures are taken to manage an overdose, such as monitoring vital signs in addition to performing ECG testing for a prolonged QT interval in the case of an overdose.[L8048]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Various reductive and oxidative pathways are responsible for pretomanid metabolism, with no single major metabolic pathway identified. According to in vitro studies, CYP3A4 is responsible for a 20% contribution to the metabolism of pretomanid.[L8048]</metabolism>
  <absorption>This drug is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The steady-state Cmax of pretomanid was estimated to be 1.7 μg/mL after a single 200mg oral dose.[L8048] In a separate pharmacokinetic modeling study, the Cmax of a 200mg dose was 1.1 μg/ml.[A182888] Tmax in a study of healthy subjects in the fed or unfed state was achieved within 4 to 5 hours.[L8048] The AUC in the same study was found to be about 28.1 μg•hr/mL in the fasted state and about 51.6 μg•hr/mL in the fed state, showing higher absorption when taken with high-calorie and high-fat food.[L8048]</absorption>
  <half-life>The elimination half-life was determined to be 16.9-17.4 hours in a pharmacokinetic study of healthy subjects.[L8048] An FDA briefing document reports a half-life of 18 hours.[L8057]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>The plasma protein binding of pretomanid is about 86.4%.[L8048]</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Healthy adult male volunteers were administered a 1,100 mg oral dose of radiolabeled pretomanid in one pharmacokinetic study. An average of about 53% of the radioactive dose was found to be excreted in the urine. Approximately 38% was measured mainly as metabolites in the feces. A estimated 1% of the radiolabeled dose was measured as unchanged drug in the urine.[L8048]</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>A pharmacokinetic modeling study estimated the volume of distribution at 130 ± 5L.[A182888] A pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers determined a volume of distribution of about 180 ± 51.3L in fasted state and 97.0 ± 17.2L in the fed state.[L8048]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The clearance of pretomanid in a pharmacokinetic simulation study has been estimated at 4.8 ± 0.2 liters/h.[A182888]&#13;
According to the FDA label, the clearance of a single 200 mg oral dose of pretomanid is estimated to be 7.6 liters/h in the fasted state, and 3.9 liters/h in the fed state.[L8048]</clearance>

        <name>Nucleoid-associated protein Lsr2</name>
        <general-function>DNA-bridging protein that has both architectural and regulatory roles (PubMed:18187505). Influences the organization of chromatin and gene expression by binding non-specifically to DNA, with a preference for AT-rich sequences, and bridging distant DNA segments (PubMed:20133735). Binds in the minor groove of AT-rich DNA (PubMed:21673140). Represses expression of multiple genes involved in a broad range of cellular processes, including major virulence factors or antibiotic-induced genes, such as iniBAC or efpA (PubMed:17590082), and genes important for adaptation of changing O(2) levels (PubMed:24895305). May also activate expression of some gene (PubMed:24895305). May coordinate global gene regulation and virulence (PubMed:20133735). Also protects mycobacteria against reactive oxygen intermediates during macrophage infection by acting as a physical barrier to DNA degradation (PubMed:19237572); the physical protection has been questioned (PubMed:24895305). A strain overexpressing this protein consumes O(2) more slowly than wild-type (PubMed:24895305).</general-function>

        <general-function>Enoyl-ACP reductase of the type II fatty acid syntase (FAS-II) system, which is involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids, a major component of mycobacterial cell walls (PubMed:25227413). Catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of the double bond of 2-trans-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein], an essential step in the fatty acid elongation cycle of the FAS-II pathway (PubMed:7599116). Shows preference for long-chain fatty acyl thioester substrates (&gt;C16), and can also use 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs as alternative substrates (PubMed:7599116). The mycobacterial FAS-II system utilizes the products of the FAS-I system as primers to extend fatty acyl chain lengths up to C56, forming the meromycolate chain that serves as the precursor for final mycolic acids (PubMed:25227413).</general-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

      <polypeptide id="P9WP15" source="Swiss-Prot">
        <name>Deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase</name>
        <general-function>Involved in a F420-dependent anti-oxidant mechanism that protects M.tuberculosis against oxidative stress and bactericidal agents. Catalyzes the F420H(2)-dependent two-electron reduction of quinones to dihydroquinones, thereby preventing the formation of cytotoxic semiquinones obtained by the one-electron reduction pathway (PubMed:23240649). In vitro, catalyzes the reduction of both benzoquinone and naphthoquinone analogs; since menaquinone is the sole quinone electron carrier in the respiratory chain in M.tuberculosis, the physiological electron acceptor for Fqr-mediated F420H(2) oxidation is therefore likely to be the endogenous menaquinone found in the membrane fraction of M.tuberculosis (PubMed:23240649). Is able to use F420 species with two and five glutamate residues in its polyglutamate tail (PubMed:22023140). Cannot use NADH or NADPH instead of F420H(2) as the electron donor (PubMed:23240649).</general-function>
