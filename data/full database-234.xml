  <name>Mesalazine</name>
  <description>An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease [A174022]. It is considered to be the active moiety of sulphasalazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed) Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent [A174019]. Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules [A174019]. In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained [A174019, A174022].</description>

  <indication>Mesalazine is indicated for the induction of remission in patients with active or mild to moderate acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis and for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis [FDA Label], [L5101]. Prescribing information for mesalazine in the UK also indicates the medication for the maintenance of remission of Crohn's ileo-colitis [L5101].</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Mesalazine is one of the two components of sulphasalazine, the other being sulphapyridine. It is the latter which is responsible for the majority of the side effects associated with sulphasalazine therapy whilst mesalazine is known to be the active moiety in the treatment of ulcerative colitis [L5101].&#13;
&#13;
The pharmacodynamic actions of mesalazine occur in the colonic/rectal mucosae local to the delivery of drug from mesalazine tablets into the lumen [FDA Label]. There is information suggesting that the severity of colonic inflammation in ulcerative colitis patients treated with mesalazine is inversely correlated with mucosal concentrations of mesalazine [FDA Label]. Plasma concentrations representing systemically absorbed mesalazine are not believed to contribute extensively to efficacy [FDA Label].</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Although the mechanism of action of mesalazine is not fully understood, it is believed to possess a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells [FDA Label]. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalazine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, mesalazine also has the potential to inhibit the activation of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NKkB) and consequently the production of key of pro-inflammatory cytokines [FDA Label]. It has been proposed that reduced expression of PPAR gamma nuclear receptors (gamma form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) may be implicated in ulcerative colitis [FDA Label]. There is evidence that mesalazine produces pharmacodynamic effects through direct activation of PPAR gamma receptors in the colonic/rectal epithelium as well [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, since increased leukocyte migration, abnormal cytokine production, increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly leukotriene B4, and increased free radical formation in the inflamed intestinal tissue are all present in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it is also believed that mesalazine has in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological effects that inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, decrease cytokine and leukotriene production and scavenge for free radicals [L5107].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>Oral, mouse: LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 3370 mg/kg; Oral, rat: LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 2800 mg/kg; Skin, rabbit: LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;gt;5 gm/kg [MSDS].&#13;
&#13;
There have been no documented reports of serious toxicity in man resulting from massive overdosing with mesalamine. Under ordinary circumstances, mesalazine absorption from the colon is limited. Although there is little to no clinical experience with mesalazine overdosage [FDA Label]. Mesalazine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may be possible, such as tinnitus, vertigo, headache, confusion, drowsiness, sweating, hyperventilation, vomiting, and diarrhea [FDA Label].  Severe intoxication with salicylates can lead to disruption of electrolyte balance and blood-pH, hyperthermia, and dehydration [FDA Label]. </toxicity>
  <metabolism>The primary metabolite of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is predominantly N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) [FDA Label]. This metabolite is generated via N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in the liver and intestinal mucosa cells, largely by NAT-1, in particular [FDA Label].</metabolism>
  <absorption>Depending on the formulation administered, prescribing information for orally administered delayed-released tablets of 2.4g or 4.8g of mesalazine given once daily for 14 days to healthy volunteers was to found to be about 21% to 22% of the administered dose [FDA Label] while prescribing information for an orally administered controlled-release capsule formulation suggests 20% to 30% of the mesalazine in the formulation is absorbed [F3001]. In contrast, when mesalamine is administered orally as an unformulated 1-g aqueous suspension, mesalazine is approximately 80% absorbed [F3001]. </absorption>
  <half-life>The apparent elimination half-life documented for oral delayed-release mesalazine tablets is 7 to 12 hours [L5122]. The elimination half-life recorded for the active N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite generated from the administration of oral delayed-release mesalazine tablets is 12 to 23 hours [L5122].</half-life>
  <protein-binding>Mesalazine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins [FDA Label], [L5122].</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Elimination of mesalazine is mainly via the renal route following metabolism to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (acetylation) [FDA Label]. However, there is also limited excretion of the parent mesalazine drug in the urine [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
After the oral administration of the extended-release formulation of mesalazine, of the approximately 21% to 22% of the drug absorbed, less than 8% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine after 24 hours, compared with greater than 13% for N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
When given the controlled-release formulation, about 130 mg free mesalazine was recovered in the feces following a single 1-g dose, which was comparable to the 140 mg of mesalazine recovered from the molar equivalent sulfasalazine tablet dose of 2.5 g F3001]. Elimination of free mesalazine and salicylates in feces increased proportionately with the dose given. N-acetylmesalazine was the primary compound excreted in the urine (19% to 30%) following the controlled-release dosing [F3001]. </route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) of the drug in adults is approximately 0.2 L/kg [L5122].</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The mean (SD) renal clearance in L/h for mesalazine following the single dose administration of mesalazine delayed-release tablets 4.8g under fasting conditions to young and elderly subjects was documented as 2.05 (1.33) in young subjects aged 18 to 35 years old, 2.04 (1.16) in elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years old, and 2.13 (1.20) in elderly subjects older than 75 years [FDA Label].</clearance>

        <specific-function>Converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Constitutively expressed in some tissues in physiological conditions, such as the endothelium, kidney and brain, and in pathological conditions, such as in cancer. PTGS2 is responsible for production of inflammatory prostaglandins. Up-regulation of PTGS2 is also associated with increased cell adhesion, phenotypic changes, resistance to apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis. In cancer cells, PTGS2 is a key step in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays important roles in modulating motility, proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Involved in the constitutive production of prostanoids in particular in the stomach and platelets. In gastric epithelial cells, it is a key step in the generation of prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which plays an important role in cytoprotection. In platelets, it is involved in the generation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which promotes platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.</specific-function>

        <name>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma</name>
        <general-function>Zinc ion binding</general-function>
        <specific-function>Nuclear receptor that binds peroxisome proliferators such as hypolipidemic drugs and fatty acids. Once activated by a ligand, the nuclear receptor binds to DNA specific PPAR response elements (PPRE) and modulates the transcription of its target genes, such as acyl-CoA oxidase. It therefore controls the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acids. Key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. ARF6 acts as a key regulator of the tissue-specific adipocyte P2 (aP2) enhancer. Acts as a critical regulator of gut homeostasis by suppressing NF-kappa-B-mediated proinflammatory responses. Plays a role in the regulation of cardiovascular circadian rhythms by regulating the transcription of ARNTL/BMAL1 in the blood vessels (By similarity).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses. Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. Negatively regulates the pathway by phosphorylating the scaffold protein TAXBP1 and thus promoting the assembly of the A20/TNFAIP3 ubiquitin-editing complex (composed of A20/TNFAIP3, TAX1BP1, and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11). Therefore, CHUK plays a key role in the negative feedback of NF-kappa-B canonical signaling to limit inflammatory gene activation. As part of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappa-B activation, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. In turn, these complexes regulate genes encoding molecules involved in B-cell survival and lymphoid organogenesis. Participates also in the negative feedback of the non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by phosphorylating and destabilizing MAP3K14/NIK. Within the nucleus, phosphorylates CREBBP and consequently increases both its transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase activities. Modulates chromatin accessibility at NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters by phosphorylating histones H3 at 'Ser-10' that are subsequently acetylated at 'Lys-14' by CREBBP. Additionally, phosphorylates the CREBBP-interacting protein NCOA3. Also phosphorylates FOXO3 and may regulate this pro-apoptotic transcription factor (PubMed:15084260).</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses. Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on 2 critical serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. In addition to the NF-kappa-B inhibitors, phosphorylates several other components of the signaling pathway including NEMO/IKBKG, NF-kappa-B subunits RELA and NFKB1, as well as IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE. IKK-related kinase phosphorylations may prevent the overproduction of inflammatory mediators since they exert a negative regulation on canonical IKKs. Phosphorylates FOXO3, mediating the TNF-dependent inactivation of this pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Also phosphorylates other substrates including NCOA3, BCL10 and IRS1. Within the nucleus, acts as an adapter protein for NFKBIA degradation in UV-induced NF-kappa-B activation.</specific-function>

        <name>Arylamine N-acetyltransferase</name>
        <general-function>Catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the free amino group of arylamines and hydrazines (PubMed:18795795). Is able to utilize not only acetyl-CoA, but also n-propionyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA as acyl donors, although at a lower rate (PubMed:19014350). As acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA are products of cholesterol catabolism and the nat gene is likely present in the same operon than genes involved in cholesterol degradation, this enzyme could have a role in the utilization and regulation of these CoA species (PubMed:19014350).</general-function>
