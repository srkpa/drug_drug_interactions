  <name>Vitamin D</name>
  <description>Vitamin D ultimately comprises a group of lipid-soluble secosteroids responsible for a variety of biological effects, some of which include increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. With reference to human use, there are 2 main forms of vitamin D - vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). When non-specific references are made about 'vitamin d', the references are usually about the use of vitamin D3 and/or D2.&#13;
&#13;
Vitamin D3 and D2 require hydroxylation in order to become biologically active in the human body. Since vitamin D can be endogenously synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient quantities of sunlight, vitamin D functions like a hormone on vitamin D receptors to regulate calcium in opposition to parathyroid hormone. Vitamin D plays an essential physiological role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and metabolism. There are several different vitamin D supplements that are given to treat or to prevent osteomalacia and rickets, or to meet the daily criteria of vitamin D consumption.</description>

  <indication>Vitamin D is indicated for use in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, refractory rickets (also known as vitamin D resistant rickets), and familial hypophosphatemia [FDA Label].</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 or D2 occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [FDA Label]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [FDA Label]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [FDA Label]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [FDA Label]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [FDA Label].</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L1768].&#13;
&#13;
Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulates the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].&#13;
&#13;
Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>The use of pharmacological or nutraceutical vitamin d and/or even excessive dietary intake of vitamin d is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcemia, malabsorption syndrome, abnormal sensitivity to the toxic effects of vitamin d, and hypervitaminosis D [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Hypersensitivity to vitamin d is one plausible etiologic factor in infants with idiopathic hypercalcemia - a case in which vitamin d use must be strictly restricted [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
As vitamin d intake is available via fortified foods, dietary supplements, and clinical drug sources, serum concentrations and therapeutic dosages should be reviewed regularly and readjusted as soon as there is clinical improvement [FDA Label]. Dosage levels are required to be individualized on an individual patient by patient basis as caution must be exercised to prevent the presence of too much vitamin d in the body and the various potentially serious toxic effects associated with such circumstances [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
In particular, the range between therapeutic and toxic doses is quite narrow in vitamin d resistant rickets [FDA Label]. When high therapeutic doses are used, progress should be followed with frequent blood calcium determinations [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
When treating hypoparathyroidism, intravenous calcium, parathyroid hormone, and/or dihydrotachysterol may be required [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Maintenance of normal serum phosphorus levels by dietary phosphate restriction and/or administration of aluminum gels as intestinal phosphate binders in those patients with hyperphosphatemia as frequently seen in renal osteodystrophy is essential to prevent metastatic calcification [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Mineral oil interferes with the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins, including vitamin d preparations [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
The administration of thiazide diuretics to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with vitamin d can result in hypercalcemia [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
At this time, no long term animal studies have been performed to evaluate vitamin potential for carcinogens, mutagenesis, or fertility [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
As various animal reproduction studies have demonstrated fetal abnormalities in several species associated with hypervitaminosis D, the use of vitamin d in excess of the recommended dietary allowance during normal pregnancy should be avoided [FDA Label]. The safety in excess of 400 USP units of vitamin d daily during pregnancy has not been established [FDA Label]. The abnormalities observed are similar to the supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome described in infants that is characterized by supravalvular aortic stenosis, elfin facies, and mental retardation [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
In a nursing mother given large doses of vitamin D, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol appeared in the milk and caused hypercalcemia in her child. Caution is subsequently required when contemplating the use of vitamin d in a nursing woman, and the necessity of monitoring infants' serum calcium concentration if vitamin d is administered to a breastfeeding woman [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
Adverse reactions associated with the use of vitamin d are primarily linked to having hypervitaminosis D occurring [FDA Lanel]. In particular, hypervitaminosis D is characterized by effects specific effects on specific organ systems. At the renal system, hypervitaminosis D can cause impairment of renal function with polyuria, nocturne, polydipsia, hypercalciuria, reversible asotemia, hypertension, nephrocalcinosis, generalized vascular calcification, or even irreversible renal insufficiency which may result in death [FDA Label]. Elsewhere, hypervitaminosis D can also cause CNS mental retardation [FDA Label]. At the level of soft tissues, it can widespread calcification of the soft tissues, including the heart, blood vessels, renal tubules, and lungs [FDA Label]. In the skeletal system, bone demineralization (osteoporosis) in adults can occur while a decline in the average rate of linear growth and increased mineralization of bones, dwarfism, vague aches, stiffness, and weakness can occur in infants and children [FDA Label]. Finally, hypervitaminosis D can also lead to nausea, anorexia, and constipation at the gastrointestinal level as well as mild acidosis, anemia, or weight loss via metabolic processes [FDA Label].&#13;
&#13;
The LD(50) in animals is unknown [FDA Label].</toxicity>
  <metabolism>In the liver, vitamin D3 and D2 are hydroxylated to calcidiol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) [A243] and ercalcidiol (25-hydroxyergocalciferol) [A223], respectively, by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase. At the level of the kidney, calcidiol and ercalcidiol are hydroxylated to yield calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) [A243] and ercalcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol) [A223], the primary biologically active forms of vitamin D3 and D2 respectively, by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase.&#13;
&#13;
</metabolism>
  <absorption>Vitamin D3 and D2 are readily absorbed from the small intestine (proximal or distal) [A223, A243].</absorption>
  <half-life>Although certain studies suggest the half-life of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D3 may be approximately 15 hours, the half-life of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 appears to have a half-life of about 15 days [L1782]. Intriguingly however, the half-lives of any particular administration of vitamin d can vary and in general the half-lives of vitamin D2 metabolites have been demonstrated to be shorter overall than vitamin D3 half-lives with this being affected by vitamin d binding protein concentrations and genotype in particular individuals [A32185].</half-life>
  <protein-binding>Some studies suggest vitamin D3 demonstrates protein binding of 50-80% [A243] while others discuss vitamin D2 having &gt;99.8% protein binding [A223].</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>The primary excretion route of vitamin D is via the bile into the feces [A32180].</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution/>
  <clearance>Some studies propose an estimated clearance rate for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D as 31 +/- 4 ml/min in healthy adults [T140].</clearance>

        <name>Vitamin D3 receptor</name>
        <general-function>Zinc ion binding</general-function>
        <specific-function>Nuclear hormone receptor. Transcription factor that mediates the action of vitamin D3 by controlling the expression of hormone sensitive genes. Recruited to promoters via its interaction with BAZ1B/WSTF which mediates the interaction with acetylated histones, an essential step for VDR-promoter association. Plays a central role in calcium homeostasis.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>
