  <name>Benzimate</name>
  <description>Benzimate is the lead compound selected from a series of compounds known as benzimidazoles. The anti-cancer and anti-viral activity of the benzimidazoles was originally investigated by the Proctor &amp; Gamble Company beginning in the 1990's. It is currently under investigation by AmpliMed and is in phase I of clinical trial.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>Benzimate is a systemic fungicide with antitumor activity against a broad spectrum of tumors both in vitro and in vivo such as pancreas, prostate, colon, and breast. Studies indicate that benzimate may interfere with mitosis and thus may disrupt or inhibit microtubule function resulting in apoptosis. Benzimate is active in p53 positive and negative tumor cell lines and in tumor cells with multi-drug resistance to other agents. Further, it appears to induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase portion of the cell cycle.</mechanism-of-action>
