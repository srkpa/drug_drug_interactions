  <indication>Investigated for use/treatment in psoriasis and psoriatic disorders.</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>VTP-201227 is a potent, selective inhibitor of two specific enzymes that are active in the skin. Therapeutic targeting of these enzymes by VTP-201227 promotes naturally-occurring healing processes within the skin. The compound has been designed to be rapidly inactivated in systemic circulation and thus has the potential to have a more favorable safety profile. In preclinical animal models, VTP-201227 was shown to exhibit a superior therapeutic index compared to other topical dermatology drugs.</pharmacodynamics>
