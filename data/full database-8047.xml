  <name>Nivolumab</name>
  <description>Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). This molecule was produced entirely on mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It is developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and originally FDA approved on December 22, 2014. Since this approval, nivolumab has been approved for a variety of other uses related to cancer therapy. On 2017, was notably approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma[L3632] and on July 11, 2018, the FDA approved this agent in combination with low doses of [ipilimumab] for the treatment of MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.[L3611]</description>

  <pharmacodynamics>In vitro testing showed a nivolumab-induced cytokine upregulation as well as an antigen-specific response of PD-1-positive T cells. The invitro pharmacodynamics studies were based on the occupancy on circulating CD3 positive T cells and they indicated a maximal occupancy of 85%. Initial clinical trials have shown that in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma nivolumab presented an overall survival rate of 42%, 63% and 70% respectively.[A35187]&#13;
&#13;
In phase I clinical trials, patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the objective response rate (ORR) was registered to be of maximum 18% with a median overall survival (mOS) of 9.4 months. When nivolumab was used as a first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the objective response rate was 30% and the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 29.6% with a mOS of 9.9 months. In melanoma, the combination of [ipilimumab] and nivolumab or nivolumab monotherapy on patients pre-treated with [ipilimumab] was 40% and 20% respectively. In metastatic renal cell carcinoma, the median duration of response was 12.9 month while the response rate for Hodgkin's lymphoma was 87% with a ratio of stable disease of 13%.[A35217]&#13;
&#13;
In phase II clinical trials in lung cancer, the mPFS and mOS was 1.9 and 8.2 months respectively. In melanoma, the ORR of the combination therapy with [ipilimumab] was 61% as compared with 11% on the [ipilimumab] monotherapy. The mPFS, ORR and mOS for the maximal concentration of nivolumab was 4.2 months, 20%, and 24.7 months respectively while the mPFS and mOS in ovarian cancer were reported to be 3.5 and 20 months respectively.[A35217]&#13;
&#13;
Phase III studies in lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma were performed showing a mOS of 9.2 and 25 months respectively; the mPFS for this conditions was 3.5 and 4.6 months respectively. In the case of melanoma, the ORR was 31.7% and the mPFS of nivolumab alone was 7 months.[A35217]&#13;
&#13;
The combination of nivolumab and [ipilimumab] was studied in clinical trials and it was shown to produce an objective response in 40% of the patients studied which was significantly higher when compared to patients receiving nivolumab as a monotherapy when pretreated with [ipilimumab].[A35203] In clinical trials, the results were based on the reports that indicated significant improvement in overall survival and objective response rate of 42%.[L3590] This combination was also confirmed by trials with progression after therapy colorectal cancer which obtained an overall response rate of 46% and 89% of those has a response duration of over 6 months.[L3611]</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>PD-1 is a member of the CD28 T-cell receptor family which makes it be expressed mainly in T-cells, B cells and myeloid cells. PD-1 is upregulated after chronic antigen stimulation and produces a state of T-cell exhaustion. The ligands for PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are induced by the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma. Tumor studies have shown to express both of the PD-1 ligands. When PD-L1 and PD-L2 are bound to PD-1, this produces an inhibitory signal in the T cells which interrupts the immune response. Therefore, nivolumab blocks the immune checkpoint PD-1. The strategy behind this mechanism is related to the reduction of the inhibitory signaling and to restore the patient's natural tumor-specific T-cell immune response.[A35187] &#13;
&#13;
The combination of nivolumab and [ipilimumab] are based on the fact that PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints have nonredundant roles on T-cell modulation.[A35187]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>In vitro studies did not show antibody-dependent cell-mediated or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.[A35187] Long-term studies with nivolumab have nos shown a significant effect of this agent in the fertility. No studies regarding the carcinogenicity, genotoxicity or short-term effect on fertility have been performed. Some of the most serious effects are related to an increased severity of infectious and inflammatory response.[FDA label]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>There have not been formal studies regarding the specific metabolism of nivolumab but as a human monoclonal antibody, it has been suggested to not be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme but to be degraded to small peptides and individual amino acids.[F655]</metabolism>
  <absorption>Pharmacokinetic studies have suggested that nivolumab presents linear pharmacokinetics with a dose-proportional increase in peak concentration and AUC. The time to peak plasma concentration ranges between 1-4 hours.[A35187] The absorption pharmacokinetic properties respective to the administration of a dose of 10 mg/kg are reported to be Cmax, Tmax and AUC of 242 mcg/kg, 2.99 hours and 68100 mcg.h/ml respectively.[A35285]</absorption>
  <half-life>Serum half-life is calculated to range around 20 days[A35187] with an elimination half-life of 26.7 days.[A35290]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>There is no information regarding the plasma protein binding of nivolumab.[F656]</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>There have not been studies regarding the specific elimination route of nivolumab.[F656]</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The volume of distribution at steady state when a dose of 10 mg/kg of nivolumab is administered is reported to be 91.1 ml/kg.[A35285] At doses ranging from 0.1 to 20 mg/kg the volume of distribution is reported to be 8 L.[A35290]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The estimated clearance rate for nivolumab is 9.4 ml/h.[A35284] The clearance rate seems to be increased according to the body weight.[A35290]</clearance>
