  <name>Magnesium gluconate</name>
  <description>Magnesium gluconate is a magnesium salt of gluconate. It demonstrates the highest oral bioavailability of magnesium salts [L2608] and is used as a mineral supplement. Magnesium is ubiquitous in the human body, and is naturally present in many foods, added to other food products, available as a dietary supplement and used as an ingredient in some medicines (such as antacids and laxatives) [L2601].&#13;
&#13;
Although magnesium is available in the form of sulphates, lactate, hydroxide, oxide and chloride, only magnesium gluconate is recommended for magnesium supplementation as it appears to be better absorbed and causes less diarrha [A32821].&#13;
&#13;
This drug has been studied in the prevention of pregnancy-induced hypertension, and has displayed promising results [A32807]. In addition, it has been studied for its effects on premature uterine contractions [A32808].</description>

  <indication>Magnesium gluconate is a mineral supplement which is used to prevent and treat low levels of magnesium. Magnesium is very important for the normal physiologic functioning of cells, nerves, muscles, bones, and the heart. Generally, a well-balanced diet provides the necessary amounts of magnesium for homeostasis. However, certain conditions causing chronic magnesium deficiency may decrease levels of magnesium. These conditions include treatment with diuretics, a poor diet, alcoholism, or other medical conditions (e.g., severe diarrhea/vomiting, stomach/intestinal absorption problems, poorly controlled diabetes) [L2600].</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Magnesium is a cofactor in over 300 enzyme systems that regulate a variety of biochemical reactions in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium is necessary for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis [L2601]. &#13;
&#13;
</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Replaces deficient circulating levels of magnesium [L2602].&#13;
&#13;
By competing with calcium for membrane binding sites and by stimulating calcium sequestration by sarcoplasmic reticulum, magnesium helps in the maintenance of a low resting intracellular free calcium ion concentration, which is essential in various cellular functions. The electrical properties of membranes and their permeability characteristics are also affected by magnesium [A32821].&#13;
&#13;
Magnesium is essential to many enzymatic reactions in the body, serving as a cofactor in protein synthesis and in carbohydrate metabolism [L2606].&#13;
&#13;
Magnesium contributes to the structural development of bone and is also essential in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione. Magnesium also plays an important role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, a process which is important to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm [L2601].&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the above, magnesium is an essential mineral required for the regulation of body temperature, nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and in preserving nerve and muscle cell electrical potentials.  Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may help to reduce fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, as well to increase birth weight [A32812].</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>Oral LD50 is 9100 mg/kg in the rat [F19].&#13;
&#13;
Excess magnesium from dietary sources does not pose a health risk in healthy individuals because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts of magnesium in the urine. On the other hand, high doses of magnesium from dietary supplements or medications often result in diarrhea that can be combined with nausea and abdominal cramping. Forms of magnesium most commonly reported to cause diarrhea include magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate, and oxide. Diarrheal and laxative effects of magnesium salts are due to the osmotic activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric motility [L2606].&#13;
&#13;
Hypermagnesaemia after oral ingestion is uncommon except in patients with renal impairment. Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia may include respiratory depression, loss of deep tendon reflexes due to neuromuscular blockade, nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypotension, drowsiness, bradycardia and muscle weakness. &#13;
&#13;
Very high doses of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids (normally providing more than 5,000 mg/day magnesium) have been associated with the occurrence of magnesium toxicity, including fatal hypermagnesemia in a 28-month-old boy as well as an elderly man. Symptoms of magnesium toxicity, normally presenting at concentrations of 1.74–2.61 mmol/L, may include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, retention of urine, ileus, depression, and lethargy before progressing to muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, extreme hypotension, irregular heartbeat, and cardiac arrest. The risk of magnesium toxicity increases with compromised renal function or kidney failure because the ability to remove excess magnesium is reduced or lost [L2601].&#13;
&#13;
Treatment: In patients with normal renal function, IV fluids or furosemide may be administered to promote the excretion of magnesium. In patients with symptomatic hypermagnesaemia, slow IV injection of calcium gluconate can be administered to antagonize the cardiac and neuromuscular effects of magnesium [L2606].</toxicity>
  <metabolism/>
  <absorption>A high-fat diet may decrease the amount of magnesium absorbed in the diet. Over-cooking food also may decrease the amount of magnesium absorbed from dietary sources [L2602].&#13;
&#13;
About 1/3 of magnesium is absorbed from the small intestine. The fraction of magnesium absorbed is inversely proportional to amount ingested [L2606].&#13;
&#13;
Oral absorption is estimated to be 15% to 30% [L2604].</absorption>
  <half-life/>
  <protein-binding>Approximately 25-30% [L2606].&#13;
&#13;
Of the protein bound fraction, 60–70% is associated with albumin and the rest is bound to other globulins [A32821].</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>Oral: Via urine (absorbed fraction); feces (unabsorbed fraction) [L2606].&#13;
&#13;
Phosphate depletion is associated with a significant increase in urinary magnesium excretion and may lead to hypomagnesemia. Hypercalcemia is associated with an increased urinary excretion of magnesium. The increase in magnesium excretion in hypercalcemia is greater than the increase in calcium excretion and is due to decreased reabsorption in the loop of Henle. Hypercalcaemia leads to a reduction in isotonic reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule causing greater delivery of sodium, water, calcium and magnesium to the loop of Henle. As a result of this increased flow to thick ascending loop of henle, calcium and magnesium transport may be inhibited. In addition, the high peritubular concentration of calcium directly inhibits the transport of both ions in this segment [A32821].&#13;
&#13;
Osmotic diuretics such as mannitol and glucose cause a marked increase in magnesium excretion. Loop diuretics induce hypermagnesuria, and the increase in magnesium excretion is greater than that of sodium or calcium suggesting that loop diuretics may directly inhibit magnesium transport [A32821].</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>About 60% of the magnesium is present in bone, of which 30% is exchangeable and functions as a reservoir to stabilize the serum concentration. About 20% is found in skeletal muscle, 19% in other soft tissues and less than 1% in the extracellular fluid. Skeletal muscle and liver contain between 7–9 mmol/Kg wet tissue; between 20–30% of this is readily exchangeable. In healthy adults, the total serum magnesium is in the range of 0.70 and 1.10 mmol/L. Approximately 20% of this is protein bound, 65% is ionized and the rest is combined with various anions such as phosphate and citrate [A32821].</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>The kidney plays a major role in magnesium homeostasis and the maintenance of plasma magnesium concentration. Under normal circumstances, when 80% of the total plasma magnesium is ultrafiltrable, 84 mmol of magnesium is filtered daily and 95% of this amount it reabsorbed leaving about 3–5 mmol to be excreted in the urine [A32821].</clearance>

        <specific-function>Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that plays a role in many key processes linked to cell growth and survival such as cytoskeleton remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli, cell motility and adhesion, receptor endocytosis, autophagy, DNA damage response and apoptosis. Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins). Phosphorylation of WASF3 is critical for the stimulation of lamellipodia formation and cell migration. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of key regulators of these processes such as BCAR1, CRK, CRKL, DOK1, EFS or NEDD9. Phosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and more particularly promotes endocytosis of EGFR, facilitates the formation of neuromuscular synapses through MUSK, inhibits PDGFRB-mediated chemotaxis and modulates the endocytosis of activated B-cell receptor complexes. Other substrates which are involved in endocytosis regulation are the caveolin (CAV1) and RIN1. Moreover, ABL1 regulates the CBL family of ubiquitin ligases that drive receptor down-regulation and actin remodeling. Phosphorylation of CBL leads to increased EGFR stability. Involved in late-stage autophagy by regulating positively the trafficking and function of lysosomal components. ABL1 targets to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress and thereby mediates mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. ABL1 is also translocated in the nucleus where it has DNA-binding activity and is involved in DNA-damage response and apoptosis. Many substrates are known mediators of DNA repair: DDB1, DDB2, ERCC3, ERCC6, RAD9A, RAD51, RAD52 or WRN. Activates the proapoptotic pathway when the DNA damage is too severe to be repaired. Phosphorylates TP73, a primary regulator for this type of damage-induced apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspase CASP9 on 'Tyr-153' and regulates its processing in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Phosphorylates PSMA7 that leads to an inhibition of proteasomal activity and cell cycle transition blocks. ABL1 acts also as a regulator of multiple pathological signaling cascades during infection. Several known tyrosine-phosphorylated microbial proteins have been identified as ABL1 substrates. This is the case of A36R of Vaccinia virus, Tir (translocated intimin receptor) of pathogenic E.coli and possibly Citrobacter, CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) of H.pylori, or AnkA (ankyrin repeat-containing protein A) of A.phagocytophilum. Pathogens can highjack ABL1 kinase signaling to reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton for multiple purposes, like facilitating intracellular movement and host cell exit. Finally, functions as its own regulator through autocatalytic activity as well as through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, ABI1.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP turnover in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Part of the complex F(1) domain and of the central stalk which is part of the complex rotary element. Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha(3)beta(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Catalyzes the formation of the signaling molecule cAMP in response to G-protein signaling. Mediates responses to increased cellular Ca(2+)/calmodulin levels (By similarity). May be involved in regulatory processes in the central nervous system. May play a role in memory and learning. Plays a role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity probably by modulating the rhythmic synthesis of cyclic AMP in the retina (By similarity).</specific-function>
