  <name>NUC B1000</name>
  <description>NUC B1000 is an expressed interfering RNA (eiRNA)- based product consisting of a plasmid DNA construct designed to produce four short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, formulated with a proprietary cationic-lipid delivery system. [F3910] eiRNA is an approach to RNAi therapeutics, whereby a plasmid DNA coding for desired dsRNA is delivered to diseased cells enabling the cells to carry out dsRNA production internally thereby invoking the RNAi response against a targeted disease causing gene. On January 11, 2008, it was announced that NUC B1000 was entering a phase 1 human safety study of its experimental treatment for chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>With eiRNA therapeutics, the drug consists of a DNA vector which encodes the double-stranded RNA molecules. When the DNA vector is administered to a cell or organism it will cause the cell to generate multiple copies of the desired RNAi molecules inside the cell and over an extended period of time, thereby amplifying the RNAi mechanism.</mechanism-of-action>
