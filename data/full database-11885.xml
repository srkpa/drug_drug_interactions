  <name>Peanut oil</name>
  <description>Peanut oil is derived from _Arachis hypogaea_ which can be found in South America, Mexico, and Centro America. The kernels are consumed roasted but a large percentage is used for the production of vegetable oil. The peanut oil represents about 45-52% of the kernel content and it is mainly formed from monounsaturated fat from which the major component is [DB04224].[A33169]  Under the FDA, peanut oil is categorized as an approved inactive ingredient for its use in drug products.[L2242] Under Health Canada, it is approved as an active ingredient in over-the-counter combination products.[L1113]</description>

  <indication>Peanut oil is widely used in food and it is even the component for the adulteration of olive oil.[T41] It is used in over-the-counter ear drops to help lubricate the ear wax.[F124] It was also used as an ingredient in cleansing soaps, in emollient cream preparations or in laxatives.[L2892, F125]&#13;
&#13;
Peanut oil is also used usually to solubilize drugs with poor water solubility as part of the oral formulation.[T224]&#13;
&#13;
When orally administered, peanut oil has as well been researched and used to prevent heart diseases and lower cholesterol levels as well as to aid in weight loss and decrease appetite.[L2897]</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Studies comparing the effectiveness between water-based and oil-based cerumenolytics have not been informative enough. However, most of the studies have concluded that both types of ear drops are as effective to remove the wax block and the use of this agents is preferred above the mechanical removal.[T225]&#13;
&#13;
Topically administered, peanut oil effect can be observed as a softening and protection of the skin.[T226]&#13;
&#13;
Some population studies suggest people who eat nuts have a lower risk of developing heart disease. This benefit must be weighed against animal evidence that suggests peanut oil is atherogenic, perhaps due to the triglyceride content or the presence of a lectin.[L2897]</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>When used in laxatives, peanut oil lubricates and softness the feces which promotes bowel movement.[L2892]&#13;
&#13;
Ear drops containing peanut oil are usually considered a not "true cerumenolytic". A cerumenolytic causes the breakdown of keratin and wax but the oil-based cerumenolytics only soften and lubricate the wax. The peanut oil contained in this cerumenolytics serve as lubricating agents.[T225]&#13;
&#13;
Administered topically, peanut oil acts as an emollient which acts by forming an occlusive oil film on the stratum corneum which in order decreases the transepidermal water loss.[T226]&#13;
&#13;
The use of peanut oil as a cardioprotective strives in the presence of [DB14038] and [DB02709]. As well, the presence of high monounsaturated and low saturated fat content is thought to prevent heart disease and lower cholesterol.[L2897]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>The use of peanut oil must be very well labeled as individuals with peanut allergy can have a severe allergic reaction. The reactions can develop to anaphylactic reactions within minutes of the initial administration.[A33177]</toxicity>
  <metabolism>The exact pharmacokinetic of peanut oil highly depends on the route of administration. Some studies suggest that the metabolism and elimination of this agent can be done between 72 and 120 hours after administration depending on some characteristics such as body size, carrier substance, administration route, dose and health status.[T227] To know more about the pharmacokinetics of peanut oil, please visit [DB04224] as it is its main component.</metabolism>
  <absorption>The exact pharmacokinetic of peanut oil highly depends on the route of administration. Peanut oil presents a very short spam in the blood and thus, it is normally rapidly transported to the muscle and adipose tissues where it can rest over a longer period. Peanut oil is absorbed through the skin and the absorption rate depends on the size of the individual molecules, the percentage of essential oils, total dosage, and circulation state. However, the absorption after administration orally or in the mucosa is much more rapid.[T227] To know more about the pharmacokinetics of peanut oil, please visit [DB04224] as it is its main component.</absorption>
  <half-life>The exact pharmacokinetic of peanut oil highly depends on the route of administration.</half-life>
  <protein-binding>The exact pharmacokinetic of peanut oil highly depends on the route of administration. Peanut oil might bind to plasma proteins for transportation and detoxification and this binding occurs mainly in the liver.[T227] To know more about the pharmacokinetics of peanut oil, please visit [DB04224] as it is its main component.</protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>The exact pharmacokinetic of peanut oil highly depends on the route of administration.  Some studies suggest that the metabolism and elimination of this agent can be done between 72 and 120 hours after administration depending on some characteristics such as body size, carrier substance, administration route, dose and health status.[T227] To know more about the pharmacokinetics of peanut oil, please visit [DB04224] as it is its main component.</route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The exact pharmacokinetic of peanut oil highly depends on the route of administration. To know more about the pharmacokinetics of peanut oil, please visit [DB04224] as it is its main component.</volume-of-distribution>
