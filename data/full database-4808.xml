  <description>PYM50018 is a patented, orally active, neuroprotective and neuroregenerative compound. It is developed for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease). In pre-clinical models, PYM50018 has been observed to protect against neuronal damage, increase neurite outgrowth, reverse oxidative damage and reverse neuronal apoptosis in vitro. When administered orally to a transgenic pre-clinical model of ALS, PYM50018 delays the loss of muscle strength and extends survival time.</description>

  <mechanism-of-action>Although the precise molecular pathways that cause the death of motor neurones in ALS remain unknown, possible mechanisms include abnormalities in neurofilament proteins, mitochondrial alterations and glutamate mediated excitotoxicity. In pre-clinical studies, the single chemical PYM50018 a novel neurotrophic factor inducer, protects against neuronal damage, reverses the decrease of neuronal growth factors and reverses neuronal degeneration observed in motor neurones. PYM50018 also increases neurite outgrowth, reverses oxidative damage and reverses neuronal apoptosisin vitro. When administered orally to a transgenic pre-clinical model of ALS, PYM50018 delays the loss of muscle strength and extends survival time.</mechanism-of-action>
