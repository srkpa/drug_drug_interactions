  <description>ALTU-135, the Company's orally administered enzyme replacement therapy for patients with pancreatic insufficiency, is manufactured by blending three drug substance enzymes: lipase, protease and amylase. This consistent and pure enzyme combination is designed to improve fat, protein and carbohydrate absorption in pancreatic insufficient individuals. ALTU-135 has been granted orphan drug and fast-track designation as well as CMA Pilot 2 program status by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</description>

  <mechanism-of-action>As ALTU-135 consists of three enzymes, lipase, protease and amylase that are delivered in a consistent ratio and is designed to improve fat, protein, and carbohydrate absorption in pancreatic insufficient individuals. ALTU-135 is designed to be highly concentrated, stable and pure and to allow patients to take a single capsule per meal or snack, whereas current products are derived from pig pancreases and require a significantly higher pill burden. This reduced pill burden for ALTU-135 is expected to provide greater convenience for the patient and result in improved compliance and therefore effectiveness. ALTU-135 has been granted Orphan Drug designation in the United States and Europe. ALTU-135 was also granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2003, and was accepted into the FDAâ€™s Continuous Marketing Application Pilot 2 Program in February 2004.</mechanism-of-action>
