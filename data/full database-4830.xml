  <description>CG0070 is investigated in clinical trials for treating bladder cancer. CG0070 is a solid. CG0070 can potentially destroy cancer cells by two different mechanisms: direct cell killing by the virus and immune-mediated cell killing stimulated by GM-CSF. CG0070, an oncolytic virus therapy with specificity for multiple cancers, has been evaluated in numerous preclinical studies. It has been engineered to secrete GM-CSF, an immune stimulating hormone, which also serves as the adjuvant in cancer immunotherapy.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>CG0070 can potentially destroy cancer cells by two different mechanisms: direct cell killing by the virus and immune-mediated cell killing stimulated by GM-CSF. CG7870 is a genetically modified adenovirus designed to replicate in prostate cancer cells by utilizing prostate selective transcription elements to control the key early viral genes E1a and E1b. CG0070 is a replication competent adenovirus that has been shown pre-clinically to preferentially replicate in RB pathway defective cells and express the cytokine gene GM-CSF.</mechanism-of-action>
