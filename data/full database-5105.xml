  <description>AVN944 is a biotech drug that demonstrated a statistically meaningful impact on IMPDH and other proteins that are critical to activities in cancer cells, including nucleotide biosynthesis, energy and metabolism, DNA replication, apoptosis and cell cycle control. AVN944 has been associated with cancer cell death in clinical trials. It is being investigated for the treatment of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics>IMPDH is highly upregulated in most hematological cancers and in many solid tumors. AVN944 is a biotech drug that demonstrated a statistically meaningful impact in inhibiting IMPDH and other proteins that are critical to activities in cancer cells, including nucleotide biosynthesis, energy and metabolism, DNA replication, apoptosis and cell cycle control. AVN944 has been associated with cancer cell death in clinical trials. It is being investigated for the treatment of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>AVN944 inhibits IMPDH and appears to induce apoptosis. Specifically, it was found that the gene HspA1A, a marker of stress response found to correlate with depleted GTP pools in cancer cell lines, is induced within hours upon the first treatment of the drug in patients, even at the trial's lowest doses. Following continued dosing of AVN944, this marker of disease cell stress was elevated even in the absence of circulating levels of the drug between doses. </mechanism-of-action>
