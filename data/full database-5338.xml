  <name>CERE-110</name>
  <description>CERE-110 is a gene-therapy product that involves in vivo delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) genes through an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) delivery system. This drug is developed by Ceregene and currently under phase I of clinical trial.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>CERE-110 is composed of an AAV vector carrying the gene for Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a naturally occurring protein that maintains survival of nerve cells in the brain.  CERE-110 is surgically implanted by stereotactic injection into the NBM, a deep brain region where cholinergic cell degeneration occurs in Alzheimer's disease.  The cholinergic system is important in memory and cognitive function, and a reversal in the blockade of this system may restore memory.  Delivery of NGF using an AAV vector may have the potential to induce sustained expression of NGF, resulting in the restoration of normal functioning of the key neuronal cells affected in Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients. </mechanism-of-action>
