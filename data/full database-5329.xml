  <description>TAFA93 is a novel prodrug of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin which has successfully completed Phase 1 clinical development. mTOR inhibitors are currently used in the prevention of organ rejection in transplantation, the treatment of autoimmune and oncological diseases, and as a component of coated stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease.</description>

  <pharmacodynamics/>
  <mechanism-of-action>TAFA-93 has distinct mechanism of action than calcineurin inhibitors such as ISA247, Isotechnikaâ€™s lead drug. It has the pontential to be administered as a complementary therapy along with ISA247 in the prevention of organ rejection after transplantation.</mechanism-of-action>
